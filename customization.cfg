_force_all_threads="true"

# Set to true to prevent ccache from being used and set CONFIG_GCC_PLUGINS=y (which needs to be disabled for ccache to work properly)
_noccache="false"

# Set to true to use modprobed db to clean config from unneeded modules. Speeds up compilation considerably. Requires root - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Modprobed-db

#                    2: Set rq skip task.
_sched_yield_type=""

# Round Robin interval is the longest duration two tasks with the same nice level will be delayed for. When CPU time is requested by a task, it receives a time slice equal

# MuQSS default: 6ms"
# PDS default: 4ms"

_tickless=""

# Setting this to to "true" can improve latency on PDS (at the cost of throughput) and improve throughput on other schedulers (at the cost of latency) - Can improve VMs performance - Kernel default is "false"
