#### KERNEL OPTIONS ####

# Name of the default config file to use for the kernel
# Default (empty):
# - Archlinux (PKGBUILD): "config.x86_64" from the linux-tkg-config/5.y folder.
# - install.sh: Picks the .config file from the currently running kernel.
#               It is recommended to be running an official kernel before running this script, to pick off a correct .config file
# User provided:
# - Archlinux : use "config_hardened.x86_64" to get a hardened kernel. To get a complete hardened setup, you have to use "cfs" as _cpusched.
# - Any : custom user provided file, the given path should be relative to the PKGBUILD file. This enables for example to use a user stripped down .config file.
#         If the .config file isn't up to date with the chosen kernel version, any extra CONFIG_XXXX is set to its default value.
# Note: the script copies the resulting .config file as "kernelconfig.new" next to the PKGBUILD as a convenience for an eventual re-use. It gets overwritten at each run.
#       One can use "kernelconfig.new" here to always use the latest edited .config file. modprobed-db needs to be used only once for its changes to be picked up.
_configfile=""

# Disable some non-module debugging - See PKGBUILD for the list
_debugdisable="false"

# LEAVE AN EMPTY VALUE TO BE PROMPTED ABOUT FOLLOWING OPTIONS AT BUILD TIME

# For PDS and MuQSS: 0: No yield. (Recommended option for gaming on PDS and MuQSS)

#                    2: Expire timeslice and recalculate deadline. (Usually the slowest option for PDS and MuQSS, not recommended)
# For BMQ:           0: No yield.
#                    1: Deboost and requeue task. (Default)
#                    2: Set rq skip task.
_sched_yield_type=""
