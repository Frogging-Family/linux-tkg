**Due to intel_pstate poor performances as of late, I have decided to set it to passive mode to make use of the acpi_cpufreq governors passthrough, keeping full support for turbo frequencies.**

A custom Linux kernel 5.7.y with specific PDS, MuQSS and Project C / BMQ CPU schedulers related patchsets selector (stock CFS is also an option) and added tweaks for a nice interactivity/performance balance, aiming for the best gaming experience.

Various personalization options available and userpatches support (put your own patches in the same dir as the PKGBUILD, with the ".mypatch" extension.

PDS-mq was originally created by Alfred Chen : http://cchalpha.blogspot.com/

While he dropped it with kernel 5.1 in favor of its BMQ evolution/rework, my pretty bad gaming experiences with BMQ up to this point convinced me to keep PDS afloat for as long as it'll make sense/I'll be able to.

Comes with a slightly modified Arch config asking for a few core personalization settings at compilation time.

You can enable support for it at the beginning of the PKGBUILD file. Make sure to read everything you need to know about it.
