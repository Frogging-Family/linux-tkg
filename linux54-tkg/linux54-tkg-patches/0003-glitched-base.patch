+IBM ThinkPad hardware functions driver
+
+Author:  Shem Multinymous <multinymous@gmail.com>
+Project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tpctl
+Wiki:    http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/tp_smapi

+         (http://mailman.linux-thinkpad.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-thinkpad)
+
+Description
+-----------
+
+ThinkPad laptops include a proprietary interface called SMAPI BIOS
+(System Management Application Program Interface) which provides some
+hardware control functionality that is not accessible by other means.
+
+This driver exposes some features of the SMAPI BIOS through a sysfs
+interface. It is suitable for newer models, on which SMAPI is invoked
+through IO port writes. Older models use a different SMAPI interface;
+for those, try the "thinkpad" module from the "tpctl" package.
+
+WARNING:
+This driver uses undocumented features and direct hardware access.
+It thus cannot be guaranteed to work, and may cause arbitrary damage
+(especially on models it wasn't tested on).
+
+
+Module parameters
+-----------------
+
+thinkpad_ec module:
+  force_io=1 lets thinkpad_ec load on some recent ThinkPad models
+  (e.g., T400 and T500) whose BIOS's ACPI DSDT reserves the ports we need.
+tp_smapi module:
+  debug=1    enables verbose dmesg output.
+
+
+Usage
+-----
+
+Control of battery charging thresholds (in percents of current full charge
+capacity):
+
+# echo 40 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/start_charge_thresh
+# echo 70 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/stop_charge_thresh
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/*_charge_thresh
+
+    (This is useful since Li-Ion batteries wear out much faster at very
+     high or low charge levels. The driver will also keeps the thresholds
+     across suspend-to-disk with AC disconnected; this isn't done
+     automatically by the hardware.)
+
+Inhibiting battery charging for 17 minutes (overrides thresholds):
+
+# echo 17 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes
+# echo 0  > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes  # stop
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/inhibit_charge_minutes
+
+    (This can be used to control which battery is charged when using an
+     Ultrabay battery.)
+
+Forcing battery discharging even if AC power available:
+
+# echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge  # start discharge
+# echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge  # stop discharge
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/force_discharge
+
+    (When AC is connected, forced discharging will automatically stop
+     when battery is fully depleted -- this is useful for calibration.
+     Also, this attribute can be used to control which battery is discharged
+     when both a system battery and an Ultrabay battery are connected.)
+
+Misc read-only battery status attributes (see note about HDAPS below):
+
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/installed   # 0 or 1
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/state       # idle/charging/discharging
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/cycle_count # integer counter
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/current_now # instantaneous current
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/current_avg # last minute average
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/power_now   # instantaneous power
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/power_avg   # last minute average
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/last_full_capacity         # in mWh
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_percent          # remaining percent of energy (set by calibration)
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_percent_error    # error range of remaing_percent (not reset by calibration)
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_running_time     # in minutes, by last minute average power
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_running_time_now # in minutes, by instantenous power
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_charging_time    # in minutes
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/remaining_capacity         # in mWh
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/design_capacity            # in mWh
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/voltage           # in mV
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/design_voltage    # in mV
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/charging_max_current  # max charging current
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/charging_max_voltage  # max charging voltage
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/group{0,1,2,3}_voltage # see below
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/manufacturer      # string
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/model             # string
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/barcoding         # string
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/chemistry         # string
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/serial            # integer
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/manufacture_date  # YYYY-MM-DD
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/first_use_date    # YYYY-MM-DD
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/temperature  # in milli-Celsius
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/BAT0/dump         # see below
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/ac_connected      # 0 or 1
+
+The BAT0/group{0,1,2,3}_voltage attribute refers to the separate cell groups
+in each battery. For example, on the ThinkPad 600, X3x, T4x and R5x models,
+the battery contains 3 cell groups in series, where each group consisting of 2
+or 3 cells  connected in parallel. The voltage of each group is given by these
+attributes, and their sum (roughly) equals the "voltage" attribute.
+(The effective performance of the battery is determined by the weakest group,
+i.e., the one those voltage changes most rapidly during dis/charging.)
+
+The "BAT0/dump" attribute gives a a hex dump of the raw status data, which
+contains additional data now in the above (if you can figure it out). Some
+unused values are autodetected and replaced by "--":
+
+In all of the above, replace BAT0 with BAT1 to address the 2nd battery (e.g.
+in the UltraBay).
+
+
+Raw SMAPI calls:
+
+/sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+This performs raw SMAPI calls. It uses a bad interface that cannot handle
+multiple simultaneous access. Don't touch it, it's for development only.
+If you did touch it, you would so something like
+# echo '211a 100 0 0' > /sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+# cat /sys/devices/platform/smapi/smapi_request
+and notice that in the output "211a 34b b2 0 0 0 'OK'", the "4b" in the 2nd
+value, converted to decimal is 75: the current charge stop threshold.
+
+
+Model-specific status
+---------------------
+
+Works (at least partially) on the following ThinkPad model:
+* A30
+* G41
+* R40, R50p, R51, R52
+* T23, T40, T40p, T41, T41p, T42, T42p, T43, T43p, T60, T61, T400, T410, T420 (partially)
+* X24, X31, X32, X40, X41, X60, X61, X200, X201, X220 (partially)
+* Z60t, Z61m
+
+Does not work on:
+* X230 and newer
+* T430 and newer
+* Any ThinkPad Edge
+* Any ThinkPad Yoga
+* Any ThinkPad L series
+* Any ThinkPad P series
+
+Not all functions are available on all models; for detailed status, see:
+  http://thinkwiki.org/wiki/tp_smapi
+
+Please report success/failure by e-mail or on the Wiki.
+If you get a "not implemented" or "not supported" message, your laptop
+probably just can't do that (at least not via the SMAPI BIOS).
+For negative reports, follow the bug reporting guidelines below.
+If you send me the necessary technical data (i.e., SMAPI function
+interfaces), I will support additional models.
+
+
+Additional HDAPS features
+-------------------------
+
+The modified hdaps driver has several improvements on the one in mainline
+(beyond resolving the conflict with thinkpad_ec and tp_smapi):
+
+- Fixes reliability and improves support for recent ThinkPad models
+  (especially *60 and newer). Unlike the mainline driver, the modified hdaps
+  correctly follows the Embedded Controller communication protocol.
+
+- Extends the "invert" parameter to cover all possible axis orientations.
+  The possible values are as follows.
+  Let X,Y denote the hardware readouts.
+  Let R denote the laptop's roll (tilt left/right).
+  Let P denote the laptop's pitch (tilt forward/backward).
+    invert=0:   R= X  P= Y   (same as mainline)
+    invert=1:   R=-X  P=-Y   (same as mainline)
+    invert=2:   R=-X  P= Y   (new)
+    invert=3:   R= X  P=-Y   (new)
+    invert=4:   R= Y  P= X   (new)
+    invert=5:   R=-Y  P=-X   (new)
+    invert=6:   R=-Y  P= X   (new)
+    invert=7:   R= Y  P=-X   (new)
+  It's probably easiest to just try all 8 possibilities and see which yields
+  correct results (e.g., in the hdaps-gl visualisation).
+
+- Adds a whitelist which automatically sets the correct axis orientation for
+  some models. If the value for your model is wrong or missing, you can override
+  it using the "invert" parameter. Please also update the tables at
+  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/tp_smapi and
+  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/List_of_DMI_IDs
+  and submit a patch for the whitelist in hdaps.c.
+
+- Provides new attributes:
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/sampling_rate:
+    This determines the frequency at which the host queries the embedded
+    controller for accelerometer data (and informs the hdaps input devices).
+    Default=50.
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/oversampling_ratio:
+    When set to X, the embedded controller is told to do physical accelerometer
+    measurements at a rate that is X times higher than the rate at which
+    the driver reads those measurements (i.e., X*sampling_rate). This
+    makes the readouts from the embedded controller more fresh, and is also
+    useful for the running average filter (see next). Default=5
+  /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/running_avg_filter_order:
+    When set to X, reported readouts will be the average of the last X physical
+    accelerometer measurements. Current firmware allows 1<=X<=8. Setting to a
+    high value decreases readout fluctuations. The averaging is handled by the
+    embedded controller, so no CPU resources are used. Higher values make the
+    readouts smoother, since it averages out both sensor noise (good) and abrupt
+    changes (bad). Default=2.
+
+- Provides a second input device, which publishes the raw accelerometer
+  measurements (without the fuzzing needed for joystick emulation). This input
+  device can be matched by a udev rule such as the following (all on one line):
+    KERNEL=="event[0-9]*", ATTRS{phys}=="hdaps/input1",
+    ATTRS{modalias}=="input:b0019v1014p5054e4801-*",
+    SYMLINK+="input/hdaps/accelerometer-event
+
+A new version of the hdapsd userspace daemon, which uses the input device
+interface instead of polling sysfs, is available seprately. Using this reduces
+the total interrupts per second generated by hdaps+hdapsd (on tickless kernels)
+to 50, down from a value that fluctuates between 50 and 100. Set the
+sampling_rate sysfs attribute to a lower value to further reduce interrupts,
+at the expense of response latency.
+
+Licensing note: all my changes to the HDAPS driver are licensed under the
+GPL version 2 or, at your option and to the extent allowed by derivation from
+prior works, any later version. My version of hdaps is derived work from the
+mainline version, which at the time of writing is available only under
+GPL version 2.
+
+Bug reporting
+-------------
+
+Mail <multinymous@gmail.com>. Please include:
+* Details about your model,
+* Relevant "dmesg" output. Make sure thinkpad_ec and tp_smapi are loaded with
+  the "debug=1" parameter (e.g., use "make load HDAPS=1 DEBUG=1").
+* Output of "dmidecode | grep -C5 Product"
+* Does the failed functionality works under Windows?
+
+
+More about SMAPI
+----------------
+
+For hints about what may be possible via the SMAPI BIOS and how, see:
+
+* IBM Technical Reference Manual for the ThinkPad 770
+  (http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=PFAN-3TUQQD)
+* Exported symbols in PWRMGRIF.DLL or TPPWRW32.DLL (e.g., use "objdump -x").
+* drivers/char/mwave/smapi.c in the Linux kernel tree.*
+* The "thinkpad" SMAPI module (http://tpctl.sourceforge.net).
+* The SMAPI_* constants in tp_smapi.c.
+
+Note that in the above Technical Reference and in the "thinkpad" module,
+SMAPI is invoked through a function call to some physical address. However,
+the interface used by tp_smapi and the above mwave drive, and apparently
+required by newer ThinkPad, is different: you set the parameters up in the
+CPU's registers and write to ports 0xB2 (the APM control port) and 0x4F; this
+triggers an SMI (System Management Interrupt), causing the CPU to enter
+SMM (System Management Mode) and run the BIOS firmware; the results are
+returned in the CPU's registers. It is not clear what is the relation between
+the two variants of SMAPI, though the assignment of error codes seems to be
+similar.
+
+In addition, the embedded controller on ThinkPad laptops has a non-standard
+interface at IO ports 0x1600-0x161F (mapped to LCP channel 3 of the H8S chip).
+The interface provides various system management services (currently known:
+battery information and accelerometer readouts). For more information see the
+thinkpad_ec module and the H8S hardware documentation:
+http://documentation.renesas.com/eng/products/mpumcu/rej09b0300_2140bhm.pdf

+ *  thinkpad_ec.c - ThinkPad embedded controller LPC3 functions
+ *
+ *  The embedded controller on ThinkPad laptops has a non-standard interface,
+ *  where LPC channel 3 of the H8S EC chip is hooked up to IO ports
+ *  0x1600-0x161F and implements (a special case of) the H8S LPC protocol.
+ *  The EC LPC interface provides various system management services (currently
+ *  known: battery information and accelerometer readouts). This driver
+ *  provides access and mutual exclusion for the EC interface.
+*
+ *  The LPC protocol and terminology are documented here:
+ *  "H8S/2104B Group Hardware Manual",
+ *  http://documentation.renesas.com/eng/products/mpumcu/rej09b0300_2140bhm.pdf

+/*
+ *  tp_smapi.c - ThinkPad SMAPI support
+ *
+ *  This driver exposes some features of the System Management Application
+ *  Program Interface (SMAPI) BIOS found on ThinkPad laptops. It works on
+ *  models in which the SMAPI BIOS runs in SMM and is invoked by writing
+ *  to the APM control port 0xB2.
+ *  It also exposes battery status information, obtained from the ThinkPad
+ *  embedded controller (via the thinkpad_ec module).
+ *  Ancient ThinkPad models use a different interface, supported by the
+ *  "thinkpad" module from "tpctl".
+ *
+ *  Many of the battery status values obtained from the EC simply mirror
+ *  values provided by the battery's Smart Battery System (SBS) interface, so
+ *  their meaning is defined by the Smart Battery Data Specification (see
+ *  http://sbs-forum.org/specs/sbdat110.pdf). References to this SBS spec
+ *  are given in the code where relevant.

Subject: avl: Use [defer+madvise] as default khugepaged defrag strategy

For some reason, the default strategy to respond to THP fault fallbacks
is still just madvise, meaning stall if the program wants transparent
hugepages, but don't trigger a background reclaim / compaction if THP
begins to fail allocations.  This creates a snowball affect where we
still use the THP code paths, but we almost always fail once a system
has been active and busy for a while.

The option "defer" was created for interactive systems where THP can
still improve performance.  If we have to fallback to a regular page due
to an allocation failure or anything else, we will trigger a background
reclaim and compaction so future THP attempts succeed and previous
attempts eventually have their smaller pages combined without stalling
running applications.

We still want madvise to stall applications that explicitely want THP,
so defer+madvise _does_ make a ton of sense.  Make it the default for
interactive systems, especially if the kernel maintainer left
transparent hugepages on "always".

Reasoning and details in the original patch:
