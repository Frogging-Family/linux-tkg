Subject: HID: quirks: Add Apple Magic Trackpad 2 to hid_have_special_driver
 list
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The Apple Magic Trackpad 2 is handled by the magicmouse driver. And
there were severe stability issues when both drivers (hid-generic and
hid-magicmouse) were loaded for this device.

Subject: Revert "cpufreq: Avoid configuring old governors as default with intel_pstate"

This is an undesirable behavior for us since our aggressive ondemand performs
better than schedutil for gaming when using intel_pstate in passive mode.
Also it interferes with the option to select the desired default governor we have.

Subject: [PATCH] mm: vmscan: fix extreme overreclaim and swap floods

During proactive reclaim, we sometimes observe severe overreclaim, with
several thousand times more pages reclaimed than requested.

This trace was obtained from shrink_lruvec() during such an instance:

    prio:0 anon_cost:1141521 file_cost:7767
    nr_reclaimed:4387406 nr_to_reclaim:1047 (or_factor:4190)
    nr=[7161123 345 578 1111]

While he reclaimer requested 4M, vmscan reclaimed close to 16G, most of it
by swapping.  These requests take over a minute, during which the write()
to memory.reclaim is unkillably stuck inside the kernel.

Digging into the source, this is caused by the proportional reclaim
bailout logic.  This code tries to resolve a fundamental conflict: to
reclaim roughly what was requested, while also aging all LRUs fairly and
in accordance to their size, swappiness, refault rates etc.  The way it
attempts fairness is that once the reclaim goal has been reached, it stops
scanning the LRUs with the smaller remaining scan targets, and adjusts the
remainder of the bigger LRUs according to how much of the smaller LRUs was
scanned.  It then finishes scanning that remainder regardless of the
reclaim goal.

This works fine if priority levels are low and the LRU lists are
comparable in size.  However, in this instance, the cgroup that is
targeted by proactive reclaim has almost no files left - they've already
been squeezed out by proactive reclaim earlier - and the remaining anon
pages are hot.  Anon rotations cause the priority level to drop to 0,
which results in reclaim targeting all of anon (a lot) and all of file
(almost nothing).  By the time reclaim decides to bail, it has scanned
most or all of the file target, and therefor must also scan most or all of
the enormous anon target.  This target is thousands of times larger than
the reclaim goal, thus causing the overreclaim.

The bailout code hasn't changed in years, why is this failing now?  The
most likely explanations are two other recent changes in anon reclaim:

1. Before the series starting with commit 5df741963d52 ("mm: fix LRU
   balancing effect of new transparent huge pages"), the VM was
   overall relatively reluctant to swap at all, even if swap was
   configured. This means the LRU balancing code didn't come into play
   as often as it does now, and mostly in high pressure situations
   where pronounced swap activity wouldn't be as surprising.

2. For historic reasons, shrink_lruvec() loops on the scan targets of
   all LRU lists except the active anon one, meaning it would bail if
   the only remaining pages to scan were active anon - even if there
   were a lot of them.

   Before the series starting with commit ccc5dc67340c ("mm/vmscan:
   make active/inactive ratio as 1:1 for anon lru"), most anon pages
   would live on the active LRU; the inactive one would contain only a
   handful of preselected reclaim candidates. After the series, anon
   gets aged similarly to file, and the inactive list is the default
   for new anon pages as well, making it often the much bigger list.

   As a result, the VM is now more likely to actually finish large
   anon targets than before.

Change the code such that only one SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX-sized nudge toward the
larger LRU lists is made before bailing out on a met reclaim goal.

This fixes the extreme overreclaim problem.

Fairness is more subtle and harder to evaluate.  No obvious misbehavior
was observed on the test workload, in any case.  Conceptually, fairness
should primarily be a cumulative effect from regular, lower priority
scans.  Once the VM is in trouble and needs to escalate scan targets to
make forward progress, fairness needs to take a backseat.  This is also
acknowledged by the myriad exceptions in get_scan_count().  This patch
makes fairness decrease gradually, as it keeps fairness work static over
increasing priority levels with growing scan targets.  This should make
more sense - although we may have to re-visit the exact values.

==================================================================

The task hangs because of a deadlock that occurs when lock_sock() is
called in rfcomm_sk_state_change(). One such call stack is:

  rfcomm_sock_shutdown():
    lock_sock();
    __rfcomm_sock_close():
      rfcomm_dlc_close():
        __rfcomm_dlc_close():
          rfcomm_dlc_lock();
          rfcomm_sk_state_change():
            lock_sock();

lock_sock() has to be called when the sk state is changed because the
lock is not always held when rfcomm_sk_state_change() is
called. However, besides the recursive deadlock, there is also an
issue of a lock hierarchy inversion between rfcomm_dlc_lock() and
lock_sock() if the socket is locked in rfcomm_sk_state_change().

To avoid these issues, we can instead schedule the sk state change in
the global workqueue. This is already the implicit assumption about
how sk state changes happen. For example, in rfcomm_sock_shutdown(),
the call to __rfcomm_sock_close() is followed by
bt_sock_wait_state().

Additionally, the call to rfcomm_sock_kill() inside
rfcomm_sk_state_change() should be removed. The socket shouldn't be
killed here because only rfcomm_sock_release() calls sock_orphan(),
which it already follows up with a call to rfcomm_sock_kill().

 updates

Make sure that we always have a CPU round trip to let the submission
code correctly decide if a TLB flush is necessary or not.

Subject: [PATCH] soundwire: intel: Initialize clock stop timeout

The bus->clk_stop_timeout member is only initialized to a non-zero value
during the codec driver probe. This can lead to corner cases where this
value remains pegged at zero when the bus suspends, which results in an
endless loop in sdw_bus_wait_for_clk_prep_deprep().

Corner cases include configurations with no codecs described in the
firmware, or delays in probing codec drivers.

Initializing the default timeout to the smallest non-zero value avoid this
problem and allows for the existing logic to be preserved: the
bus->clk_stop_timeout is set as the maximum required by all codecs
connected on the bus.
