+==========================
+Extensible Scheduler Class
+==========================
+
+sched_ext is a scheduler class whose behavior can be defined by a set of BPF
+programs - the BPF scheduler.
+
+* sched_ext exports a full scheduling interface so that any scheduling
+  algorithm can be implemented on top.
+
+* The BPF scheduler can group CPUs however it sees fit and schedule them
+  together, as tasks aren't tied to specific CPUs at the time of wakeup.
+
+* The BPF scheduler can be turned on and off dynamically anytime.
+
+* The system integrity is maintained no matter what the BPF scheduler does.
+  The default scheduling behavior is restored anytime an error is detected,
+  a runnable task stalls, or on invoking the SysRq key sequence
+  :kbd:`SysRq-S`.
+
+Switching to and from sched_ext
+===============================
+
+``CONFIG_SCHED_CLASS_EXT`` is the config option to enable sched_ext and
+``tools/sched_ext`` contains the example schedulers.
+
+sched_ext is used only when the BPF scheduler is loaded and running.
+
+If a task explicitly sets its scheduling policy to ``SCHED_EXT``, it will be
+treated as ``SCHED_NORMAL`` and scheduled by CFS until the BPF scheduler is
+loaded. On load, such tasks will be switched to and scheduled by sched_ext.
+
+The BPF scheduler can choose to schedule all normal and lower class tasks by
+calling ``scx_bpf_switch_all()`` from its ``init()`` operation. In this
+case, all ``SCHED_NORMAL``, ``SCHED_BATCH``, ``SCHED_IDLE`` and
+``SCHED_EXT`` tasks are scheduled by sched_ext. In the example schedulers,
+this mode can be selected with the ``-a`` option.
+
+Terminating the sched_ext scheduler program, triggering :kbd:`SysRq-S`, or
+detection of any internal error including stalled runnable tasks aborts the
+BPF scheduler and reverts all tasks back to CFS.

+

+    # cat /sys/kernel/sched_ext/state
+    enabled
+    # cat /sys/kernel/sched_ext/root/ops

+detailed information:

+    enabled       : 1
+    switching_all : 1
+    switched_all  : 1
+    enable_state  : enabled (2)
+    bypass_depth  : 0
+    nr_rejected   : 0
+
+If ``CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG`` is set, whether a given task is on sched_ext can
+be determined as follows:
+
+.. code-block:: none
+
+    # grep ext /proc/self/sched
+    ext.enabled                                  :                    1
+
+The Basics
+==========
+
+Userspace can implement an arbitrary BPF scheduler by loading a set of BPF
+programs that implement ``struct sched_ext_ops``. The only mandatory field
+is ``ops.name`` which must be a valid BPF object name. All operations are
+optional. The following modified excerpt is from
+``tools/sched/scx_simple.bpf.c`` showing a minimal global FIFO scheduler.
+
+.. code-block:: c
+
+    /*
+     * Decide which CPU a task should be migrated to before being
+     * enqueued (either at wakeup, fork time, or exec time). If an
+     * idle core is found by the default ops.select_cpu() implementation,
+     * then dispatch the task directly to SCX_DSQ_LOCAL and skip the
+     * ops.enqueue() callback.
+     *
+     * Note that this implemenation has exactly the same behavior as the
+     * default ops.select_cpu implementation. The behavior of the scheduler
+     * would be exactly same if the implementation just didn't define the
+     * simple_select_cpu() struct_ops prog.
+     */
+    s32 BPF_STRUCT_OPS(simple_select_cpu, struct task_struct *p,
+                       s32 prev_cpu, u64 wake_flags)
+    {
+            s32 cpu;
+            /* Need to initialize or the BPF verifier will reject the program */
+            bool direct = false;
+
+            cpu = scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl(p, prev_cpu, wake_flags, &direct);
+
+            if (direct)
+                    scx_bpf_dispatch(p, SCX_DSQ_LOCAL, SCX_SLICE_DFL, 0);
+
+            return cpu;
+    }
+
+    /*
+     * Do a direct dispatch of a task to the global DSQ. This ops.enqueue()
+     * callback will only be invoked if we failed to find a core to dispatch

+            .name                   = "simple",
+    };
+
+Dispatch Queues
+---------------
+
+To match the impedance between the scheduler core and the BPF scheduler,
+sched_ext uses DSQs (dispatch queues) which can operate as both a FIFO and a
+priority queue. By default, there is one global FIFO (``SCX_DSQ_GLOBAL``),
+and one local dsq per CPU (``SCX_DSQ_LOCAL``). The BPF scheduler can manage
+an arbitrary number of dsq's using ``scx_bpf_create_dsq()`` and
+``scx_bpf_destroy_dsq()``.
+
+A CPU always executes a task from its local DSQ. A task is "dispatched" to a
+DSQ. A non-local DSQ is "consumed" to transfer a task to the consuming CPU's
+local DSQ.
+
+When a CPU is looking for the next task to run, if the local DSQ is not
+empty, the first task is picked. Otherwise, the CPU tries to consume the
+global DSQ. If that doesn't yield a runnable task either, ``ops.dispatch()``
+is invoked.
+
+Scheduling Cycle
+----------------
+
+The following briefly shows how a waking task is scheduled and executed.
+
+1. When a task is waking up, ``ops.select_cpu()`` is the first operation
+   invoked. This serves two purposes. First, CPU selection optimization
+   hint. Second, waking up the selected CPU if idle.
+
+   The CPU selected by ``ops.select_cpu()`` is an optimization hint and not
+   binding. The actual decision is made at the last step of scheduling.
+   However, there is a small performance gain if the CPU
+   ``ops.select_cpu()`` returns matches the CPU the task eventually runs on.
+
+   A side-effect of selecting a CPU is waking it up from idle. While a BPF
+   scheduler can wake up any cpu using the ``scx_bpf_kick_cpu()`` helper,
+   using ``ops.select_cpu()`` judiciously can be simpler and more efficient.
+
+   A task can be immediately dispatched to a DSQ from ``ops.select_cpu()`` by
+   calling ``scx_bpf_dispatch()``. If the task is dispatched to
+   ``SCX_DSQ_LOCAL`` from ``ops.select_cpu()``, it will be dispatched to the
+   local DSQ of whichever CPU is returned from ``ops.select_cpu()``.
+   Additionally, dispatching directly from ``ops.select_cpu()`` will cause the
+   ``ops.enqueue()`` callback to be skipped.
+
+   Note that the scheduler core will ignore an invalid CPU selection, for
+   example, if it's outside the allowed cpumask of the task.
+
+2. Once the target CPU is selected, ``ops.enqueue()`` is invoked (unless the
+   task was dispatched directly from ``ops.select_cpu()``). ``ops.enqueue()``
+   can make one of the following decisions:
+
+   * Immediately dispatch the task to either the global or local DSQ by
+     calling ``scx_bpf_dispatch()`` with ``SCX_DSQ_GLOBAL`` or
+     ``SCX_DSQ_LOCAL``, respectively.
+
+   * Immediately dispatch the task to a custom DSQ by calling
+     ``scx_bpf_dispatch()`` with a DSQ ID which is smaller than 2^63.
+
+   * Queue the task on the BPF side.
+
+3. When a CPU is ready to schedule, it first looks at its local DSQ. If
+   empty, it then looks at the global DSQ. If there still isn't a task to
+   run, ``ops.dispatch()`` is invoked which can use the following two
+   functions to populate the local DSQ.
+
+   * ``scx_bpf_dispatch()`` dispatches a task to a DSQ. Any target DSQ can
+     be used - ``SCX_DSQ_LOCAL``, ``SCX_DSQ_LOCAL_ON | cpu``,
+     ``SCX_DSQ_GLOBAL`` or a custom DSQ. While ``scx_bpf_dispatch()``
+     currently can't be called with BPF locks held, this is being worked on
+     and will be supported. ``scx_bpf_dispatch()`` schedules dispatching
+     rather than performing them immediately. There can be up to
+     ``ops.dispatch_max_batch`` pending tasks.
+
+   * ``scx_bpf_consume()`` tranfers a task from the specified non-local DSQ
+     to the dispatching DSQ. This function cannot be called with any BPF
+     locks held. ``scx_bpf_consume()`` flushes the pending dispatched tasks
+     before trying to consume the specified DSQ.
+
+4. After ``ops.dispatch()`` returns, if there are tasks in the local DSQ,
+   the CPU runs the first one. If empty, the following steps are taken:
+
+   * Try to consume the global DSQ. If successful, run the task.
+
+   * If ``ops.dispatch()`` has dispatched any tasks, retry #3.
+
+   * If the previous task is an SCX task and still runnable, keep executing
+     it (see ``SCX_OPS_ENQ_LAST``).
+
+   * Go idle.
+
+Note that the BPF scheduler can always choose to dispatch tasks immediately
+in ``ops.enqueue()`` as illustrated in the above simple example. If only the
+built-in DSQs are used, there is no need to implement ``ops.dispatch()`` as
+a task is never queued on the BPF scheduler and both the local and global
+DSQs are consumed automatically.
+
+``scx_bpf_dispatch()`` queues the task on the FIFO of the target DSQ. Use
+``scx_bpf_dispatch_vtime()`` for the priority queue. Internal DSQs such as
+``SCX_DSQ_LOCAL`` and ``SCX_DSQ_GLOBAL`` do not support priority-queue
+dispatching, and must be dispatched to with ``scx_bpf_dispatch()``.  See the
+function documentation and usage in ``tools/sched_ext/scx_simple.bpf.c`` for
+more information.
+
+Where to Look
+=============
+
+* ``include/linux/sched/ext.h`` defines the core data structures, ops table
+  and constants.
+
+* ``kernel/sched/ext.c`` contains sched_ext core implementation and helpers.
+  The functions prefixed with ``scx_bpf_`` can be called from the BPF
+  scheduler.
+
+* ``tools/sched_ext/`` hosts example BPF scheduler implementations.
+
+  * ``scx_simple[.bpf].c``: Minimal global FIFO scheduler example using a
+    custom DSQ.
+
+  * ``scx_qmap[.bpf].c``: A multi-level FIFO scheduler supporting five
+    levels of priority implemented with ``BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE``.
+
+ABI Instability
+===============
+
+The APIs provided by sched_ext to BPF schedulers programs have no stability
+guarantees. This includes the ops table callbacks and constants defined in
+``include/linux/sched/ext.h``, as well as the ``scx_bpf_`` kfuncs defined in
+``kernel/sched/ext.c``.
+
+While we will attempt to provide a relatively stable API surface when
+possible, they are subject to change without warning between kernel
+versions.

+	  This option enables a new scheduler class sched_ext (SCX), which
+	  allows scheduling policies to be implemented as BPF programs to
+	  achieve the following:
+
+	  - Ease of experimentation and exploration: Enabling rapid
+	    iteration of new scheduling policies.
+	  - Customization: Building application-specific schedulers which
+	    implement policies that are not applicable to general-purpose
+	    schedulers.
+	  - Rapid scheduler deployments: Non-disruptive swap outs of
+	    scheduling policies in production environments.
+
+	  sched_ext leverages BPF’s struct_ops feature to define a structure
+	  which exports function callbacks and flags to BPF programs that
+	  wish to implement scheduling policies. The struct_ops structure
+	  exported by sched_ext is struct sched_ext_ops, and is conceptually
+	  similar to struct sched_class.

+ *
+ * When called from ops.select_cpu() or ops.enqueue(), it's for direct dispatch
+ * and @p must match the task being enqueued. Also, %SCX_DSQ_LOCAL_ON can't be
+ * used to target the local DSQ of a CPU other than the enqueueing one. Use
+ * ops.select_cpu() to be on the target CPU in the first place.
+ *
+ * When called from ops.select_cpu(), @enq_flags and @dsp_id are stored, and @p
+ * will be directly dispatched to the corresponding dispatch queue after
+ * ops.select_cpu() returns. If @p is dispatched to SCX_DSQ_LOCAL, it will be
+ * dispatched to the local DSQ of the CPU returned by ops.select_cpu().
+ * @enq_flags are OR'd with the enqueue flags on the enqueue path before the
+ * task is dispatched.
+ *
+ * When called from ops.dispatch(), there are no restrictions on @p or @dsq_id
+ * and this function can be called upto ops.dispatch_max_batch times to dispatch
+ * multiple tasks. scx_bpf_dispatch_nr_slots() returns the number of the
+ * remaining slots. scx_bpf_consume() flushes the batch and resets the counter.
+ *
+ * This function doesn't have any locking restrictions and may be called under
+ * BPF locks (in the future when BPF introduces more flexible locking).
+ *
+ * @p is allowed to run for @slice. The scheduling path is triggered on slice
+ * exhaustion. If zero, the current residual slice is maintained. If
+ * %SCX_SLICE_INF, @p never expires and the BPF scheduler must kick the CPU with

+SCHED_EXT EXAMPLE SCHEDULERS
+============================
+
+# Introduction
+
+This directory contains a number of example sched_ext schedulers. These
+schedulers are meant to provide examples of different types of schedulers
+that can be built using sched_ext, and illustrate how various features of
+sched_ext can be used.
+
+Some of the examples are performant, production-ready schedulers. That is, for
+the correct workload and with the correct tuning, they may be deployed in a
+production environment with acceptable or possibly even improved performance.
+Others are just examples that in practice, would not provide acceptable
+performance (though they could be improved to get there).
+
+This README will describe these example schedulers, including describing the
+types of workloads or scenarios they're designed to accommodate, and whether or
+not they're production ready. For more details on any of these schedulers,
+please see the header comment in their .bpf.c file.
+
+
+# Compiling the examples
+
+There are a few toolchain dependencies for compiling the example schedulers.
+
+## Toolchain dependencies
+
+1. clang >= 16.0.0
+
+The schedulers are BPF programs, and therefore must be compiled with clang. gcc
+is actively working on adding a BPF backend compiler as well, but are still
+missing some features such as BTF type tags which are necessary for using
+kptrs.
+
+2. pahole >= 1.25
+
+You may need pahole in order to generate BTF from DWARF.
+
+3. rust >= 1.70.0
+
+Rust schedulers uses features present in the rust toolchain >= 1.70.0. You
+should be able to use the stable build from rustup, but if that doesn't
+work, try using the rustup nightly build.
+
+There are other requirements as well, such as make, but these are the main /
+non-trivial ones.
+
+## Compiling the kernel
+
+In order to run a sched_ext scheduler, you'll have to run a kernel compiled
+with the patches in this repository, and with a minimum set of necessary
+Kconfig options:
+
+```
+CONFIG_BPF=y
+CONFIG_SCHED_CLASS_EXT=y
+CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y
+CONFIG_BPF_JIT=y
+CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y
+```
+
+It's also recommended that you also include the following Kconfig options:
+
+```
+CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON=y
+CONFIG_BPF_JIT_DEFAULT_ON=y
+CONFIG_PAHOLE_HAS_SPLIT_BTF=y
+CONFIG_PAHOLE_HAS_BTF_TAG=y
+```
+
+There is a `Kconfig` file in this directory whose contents you can append to
+your local `.config` file, as long as there are no conflicts with any existing
+options in the file.
+
+## Getting a vmlinux.h file
+
+You may notice that most of the example schedulers include a "vmlinux.h" file.
+This is a large, auto-generated header file that contains all of the types
+defined in some vmlinux binary that was compiled with
+[BTF](https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/btf.html) (i.e. with the BTF-related Kconfig
+options specified above).
+
+The header file is created using `bpftool`, by passing it a vmlinux binary
+compiled with BTF as follows:
+
+```bash
+$ bpftool btf dump file /path/to/vmlinux format c > vmlinux.h
+```
+
+`bpftool` analyzes all of the BTF encodings in the binary, and produces a
+header file that can be included by BPF programs to access those types.  For
+example, using vmlinux.h allows a scheduler to access fields defined directly
+in vmlinux as follows:
+
+```c
+#include "vmlinux.h"
+// vmlinux.h is also implicitly included by scx_common.bpf.h.
+#include "scx_common.bpf.h"
+
+/*
+ * vmlinux.h provides definitions for struct task_struct and

+
+The scheduler build system will generate this vmlinux.h file as part of the
+scheduler build pipeline. It looks for a vmlinux file in the following
+dependency order:
+
+1. If the O= environment variable is defined, at `$O/vmlinux`
+2. If the KBUILD_OUTPUT= environment variable is defined, at
+   `$KBUILD_OUTPUT/vmlinux`
+3. At `../../vmlinux` (i.e. at the root of the kernel tree where you're
+   compiling the schedulers)
+3. `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`
+4. `/boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r)`
+
+In other words, if you have compiled a kernel in your local repo, its vmlinux
+file will be used to generate vmlinux.h. Otherwise, it will be the vmlinux of
+the kernel you're currently running on. This means that if you're running on a
+kernel with sched_ext support, you may not need to compile a local kernel at
+all.
+
+### Aside on CO-RE
+
+One of the cooler features of BPF is that it supports
+[CO-RE](https://nakryiko.com/posts/bpf-core-reference-guide/) (Compile Once Run
+Everywhere). This feature allows you to reference fields inside of structs with
+types defined internal to the kernel, and not have to recompile if you load the
+BPF program on a different kernel with the field at a different offset. In our
+example above, we print out a task name with `p->comm`. CO-RE would perform
+relocations for that access when the program is loaded to ensure that it's
+referencing the correct offset for the currently running kernel.
+
+## Compiling the schedulers
+
+Once you have your toolchain setup, and a vmlinux that can be used to generate
+a full vmlinux.h file, you can compile the schedulers using `make`:
+
+```bash
+$ make -j($nproc)
+```
+
+# Schedulers
+
+This directory contains the following simple schedulers as examples. For
+more, visit https://github.com/sched-ext/scx.
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+## scx_simple
+
+### Overview
+
+A simple scheduler that provides an example of a minimal sched_ext
+scheduler. scx_simple can be run in either global weighted vtime mode, or
+FIFO mode.
+
+### Typical Use Case
+
+Though very simple, this scheduler should perform reasonably well on
+single-socket CPUs with a uniform L3 cache topology. Note that while running in
+global FIFO mode may work well for some workloads, saturating threads can
+easily drown out inactive ones.
+
+### Production Ready?
+
+This scheduler could be used in a production environment, assuming the hardware
+constraints enumerated above, and assuming the workload can accommodate a
+simple scheduling policy.
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+## scx_qmap
+
+### Overview
+
+Another simple, yet slightly more complex scheduler that provides an example of
+a basic weighted FIFO queuing policy. It also provides examples of some common
+useful BPF features, such as sleepable per-task storage allocation in the
+`ops.prep_enable()` callback, and using the `BPF_MAP_TYPE_QUEUE` map type to
+enqueue tasks. It also illustrates how core-sched support could be implemented.
+
+### Typical Use Case
+
+Purely used to illustrate sched_ext features.
+
+### Production Ready?
+
+No
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+# Troubleshooting
+
+There are a number of common issues that you may run into when building the
+schedulers. We'll go over some of the common ones here.
+
+## Build Failures
+
+### Old version of clang
+
+```
+error: static assertion failed due to requirement 'SCX_DSQ_FLAG_BUILTIN': bpftool generated vmlinux.h is missing high bits for 64bit enums, upgrade clang and pahole
+        _Static_assert(SCX_DSQ_FLAG_BUILTIN,
+                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+1 error generated.
+```
+
+This means you built the kernel or the schedulers with an older version of
+clang than what's supported (i.e. older than 16.0.0). To remediate this:
+
+1. `which clang` to make sure you're using a sufficiently new version of clang.
+
+2. `make fullclean` in the root path of the repository, and rebuild the kernel
+   and schedulers.
+
+3. Rebuild the kernel, and then your example schedulers.
+
+The schedulers are also cleaned if you invoke `make mrproper` in the root
+directory of the tree.
+
+### Stale kernel build / incomplete vmlinux.h file
+
+As described above, you'll need a `vmlinux.h` file that was generated from a
+vmlinux built with BTF, and with sched_ext support enabled. If you don't,
+you'll see errors such as the following which indicate that a type being
+referenced in a scheduler is unknown:
+
+```
+/path/to/sched_ext/tools/sched_ext/user_exit_info.h:25:23: note: forward declaration of 'struct scx_exit_info'
+
+const struct scx_exit_info *ei)
+
+^
+```
+
+In order to resolve this, please follow the steps above in
+[Getting a vmlinux.h file](#getting-a-vmlinuxh-file) in order to ensure your
+schedulers are using a vmlinux.h file that includes the requisite types.
+
+## Misc
+
+### llvm: [OFF]
+
+You may see the following output when building the schedulers:
+
+```
+Auto-detecting system features:
+...                         clang-bpf-co-re: [ on  ]
+...                                    llvm: [ OFF ]
+...                                  libcap: [ on  ]
+...                                  libbfd: [ on  ]
+```
+
+Seeing `llvm: [ OFF ]` here is not an issue. You can safely ignore.
