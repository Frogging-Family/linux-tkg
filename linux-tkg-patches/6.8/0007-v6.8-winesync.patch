+=====================================
+Wine synchronization primitive driver
+=====================================
+
+This page documents the user-space API for the winesync driver.
+
+winesync is a support driver for emulation of NT synchronization
+primitives by the Wine project or other NT emulators. It exists
+because implementation in user-space, using existing tools, cannot
+simultaneously satisfy performance, correctness, and security
+constraints. It is implemented entirely in software, and does not
+drive any hardware device.
+
+This interface is meant as a compatibility tool only, and should not
+be used for general synchronization. Instead use generic, versatile
+interfaces such as futex(2) and poll(2).
+
+Synchronization primitives
+==========================
+
+The winesync driver exposes three types of synchronization primitives:
+semaphores, mutexes, and events.
+
+A semaphore holds a single volatile 32-bit counter, and a static
+32-bit integer denoting the maximum value. It is considered signaled
+when the counter is nonzero. The counter is decremented by one when a
+wait is satisfied. Both the initial and maximum count are established
+when the semaphore is created.
+
+A mutex holds a volatile 32-bit recursion count, and a volatile 32-bit
+identifier denoting its owner. A mutex is considered signaled when its
+owner is zero (indicating that it is not owned). The recursion count
+is incremented when a wait is satisfied, and ownership is set to the
+given identifier.
+
+A mutex also holds an internal flag denoting whether its previous
+owner has died; such a mutex is said to be inconsistent. Owner death
+is not tracked automatically based on thread death, but rather must be
+communicated using ``WINESYNC_IOC_KILL_OWNER``. An inconsistent mutex
+is inherently considered unowned.
+
+Except for the "unowned" semantics of zero, the actual value of the
+owner identifier is not interpreted by the winesync driver at all. The
+intended use is to store a thread identifier; however, the winesync
+driver does not actually validate that a calling thread provides
+consistent or unique identifiers.
+
+An event holds a volatile boolean state denoting whether it is
+signaled or not. There are two types of events, auto-reset and
+manual-reset. An auto-reset event is designaled when a wait is
+satisfied; a manual-reset event is not. The event type is specified
+when the event is created.
+
+Unless specified otherwise, all operations on an object are atomic and
+totally ordered with respect to other operations on the same object.
+
+Objects are represented by unsigned 32-bit integers.
+
+Char device
+===========
+
+The winesync driver creates a single char device /dev/winesync. Each
+file description opened on the device represents a unique namespace.
+That is, objects created on one open file description are shared
+across all its individual descriptors, but are not shared with other
+open() calls on the same device. The same file description may be
+shared across multiple processes.
+
+ioctl reference
+===============
+
+All operations on the device are done through ioctls. There are three
+structures used in ioctl calls::
+
+   struct winesync_sem_args {
+   	__u32 sem;
+   	__u32 count;
+   	__u32 max;
+   };
+
+   struct winesync_mutex_args {
+   	__u32 mutex;
+   	__u32 owner;
+   	__u32 count;
+   };
+
+   struct winesync_event_args {
+   	__u32 event;
+   	__u32 signaled;
+   	__u32 manual;
+   };
+
+   struct winesync_wait_args {
+   	__u64 timeout;
+   	__u64 objs;
+   	__u32 count;
+   	__u32 owner;
+   	__u32 index;
+   	__u32 pad;
+   };
+
+Depending on the ioctl, members of the structure may be used as input,
+output, or not at all. All ioctls return 0 on success.
+
+The ioctls are as follows:
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_CREATE_SEM
+
+  Create a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - On output, contains the identifier of the created semaphore.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Initial count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - Maximum count of the semaphore.
+
+  Fails with ``EINVAL`` if ``count`` is greater than ``max``.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_CREATE_MUTEX
+
+  Create a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - On output, contains the identifier of the created mutex.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Initial recursion count of the mutex.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Initial owner of the mutex.
+
+  If ``owner`` is nonzero and ``count`` is zero, or if ``owner`` is
+  zero and ``count`` is nonzero, the function fails with ``EINVAL``.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_CREATE_EVENT
+
+  Create an event object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_event_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``event``
+       - On output, contains the identifier of the created event.
+     * - ``signaled``
+       - If nonzero, the event is initially signaled, otherwise
+         nonsignaled.
+     * - ``manual``
+       - If nonzero, the event is a manual-reset event, otherwise
+         auto-reset.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_DELETE
+
+  Delete an object of any type. Takes an input-only pointer to a
+  32-bit integer denoting the object to delete.
+
+  Wait ioctls currently in progress are not interrupted, and behave as
+  if the object remains valid.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_PUT_SEM
+
+  Post to a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - Semaphore object to post to.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Count to add to the semaphore. On output, contains the
+         previous count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - Not used.
+
+  If adding ``count`` to the semaphore's current count would raise the
+  latter past the semaphore's maximum count, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOVERFLOW`` and the semaphore is not affected. If raising the
+  semaphore's count causes it to become signaled, eligible threads
+  waiting on this semaphore will be woken and the semaphore's count
+  decremented appropriately.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_PUT_MUTEX
+
+  Release a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - Mutex object to release.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Mutex owner identifier.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the previous recursion count.
+
+  If ``owner`` is zero, the ioctl fails with ``EINVAL``. If ``owner``
+  is not the current owner of the mutex, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EPERM``.
+
+  The mutex's count will be decremented by one. If decrementing the
+  mutex's count causes it to become zero, the mutex is marked as
+  unowned and signaled, and eligible threads waiting on it will be
+  woken as appropriate.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_SET_EVENT
+
+  Signal an event object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_event_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``event``
+       - Event object to set.
+     * - ``signaled``
+       - On output, contains the previous state of the event.
+     * - ``manual``
+       - Unused.
+
+  Eligible threads will be woken, and auto-reset events will be
+  designaled appropriately.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_RESET_EVENT
+
+  Designal an event object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_event_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``event``
+       - Event object to reset.
+     * - ``signaled``
+       - On output, contains the previous state of the event.
+     * - ``manual``
+       - Unused.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_PULSE_EVENT
+
+  Wake threads waiting on an event object without leaving it in a
+  signaled state. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_event_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``event``
+       - Event object to pulse.
+     * - ``signaled``
+       - On output, contains the previous state of the event.
+     * - ``manual``
+       - Unused.
+
+  A pulse operation can be thought of as a set followed by a reset,
+  performed as a single atomic operation. If two threads are waiting
+  on an auto-reset event which is pulsed, only one will be woken. If
+  two threads are waiting a manual-reset event which is pulsed, both
+  will be woken. However, in both cases, the event will be unsignaled
+  afterwards, and a simultaneous read operation will always report the
+  event as unsignaled.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_READ_SEM
+
+  Read the current state of a semaphore object. Takes a pointer to
+  struct :c:type:`winesync_sem_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``sem``
+       - Semaphore object to read.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the current count of the semaphore.
+     * - ``max``
+       - On output, contains the maximum count of the semaphore.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_READ_MUTEX
+
+  Read the current state of a mutex object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_mutex_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``mutex``
+       - Mutex object to read.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - On output, contains the current owner of the mutex, or zero
+         if the mutex is not currently owned.
+     * - ``count``
+       - On output, contains the current recursion count of the mutex.
+
+  If the mutex is marked as inconsistent, the function fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. In this case, ``count`` and ``owner`` are set to
+  zero.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_READ_EVENT
+
+  Read the current state of an event object. Takes a pointer to struct
+  :c:type:`winesync_event_args`, which is used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``event``
+       - Event object.
+     * - ``signaled``
+       - On output, contains the current state of the event.
+     * - ``manual``
+       - On output, contains 1 if the event is a manual-reset event,
+         and 0 otherwise.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_KILL_OWNER
+
+  Mark any mutexes owned by the given owner as unowned and
+  inconsistent. Takes an input-only pointer to a 32-bit integer
+  denoting the owner. If the owner is zero, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EINVAL``.
+
+  For each mutex currently owned by the given owner, eligible threads
+  waiting on said mutex will be woken as appropriate (and such waits
+  will fail with ``EOWNERDEAD``, as described below).
+
+  The operation as a whole is not atomic; however, the modification of
+  each mutex is atomic and totally ordered with respect to other
+  operations on the same mutex.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY
+
+  Poll on any of a list of objects, atomically acquiring at most one.
+  Takes a pointer to struct :c:type:`winesync_wait_args`, which is
+  used as follows:
+
+  .. list-table::
+
+     * - ``timeout``
+       - Optional pointer to a 64-bit struct :c:type:`timespec`
+         (specified as an integer so that the structure has the same
+         size regardless of architecture). The timeout is specified in
+         absolute format, as measured against the MONOTONIC clock. If
+         the timeout is equal to or earlier than the current time, the
+         function returns immediately without sleeping. If ``timeout``
+         is zero, i.e. NULL, the function will sleep until an object
+         is signaled, and will not fail with ``ETIMEDOUT``.
+     * - ``objs``
+       - Pointer to an array of ``count`` 32-bit object identifiers
+         (specified as an integer so that the structure has the same
+         size regardless of architecture). If any identifier is
+         invalid, the function fails with ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``count``
+       - Number of object identifiers specified in the ``objs`` array.
+     * - ``owner``
+       - Mutex owner identifier. If any object in ``objs`` is a mutex,
+         the ioctl will attempt to acquire that mutex on behalf of
+         ``owner``. If ``owner`` is zero, the ioctl fails with
+         ``EINVAL``.
+     * - ``index``
+       - On success, contains the index (into ``objs``) of the object
+         which was signaled. If ``alert`` was signaled instead,
+         this contains ``count``.
+     * - ``alert``
+       - Optional event object identifier. If nonzero, this specifies
+         an "alert" event object which, if signaled, will terminate
+         the wait. If nonzero, the identifier must point to a valid
+         event.
+
+  This function attempts to acquire one of the given objects. If
+  unable to do so, it sleeps until an object becomes signaled,
+  subsequently acquiring it, or the timeout expires. In the latter
+  case the ioctl fails with ``ETIMEDOUT``. The function only acquires
+  one object, even if multiple objects are signaled.
+
+  A semaphore is considered to be signaled if its count is nonzero,
+  and is acquired by decrementing its count by one. A mutex is
+  considered to be signaled if it is unowned or if its owner matches
+  the ``owner`` argument, and is acquired by incrementing its
+  recursion count by one and setting its owner to the ``owner``
+  argument. An auto-reset event is acquired by designaling it; a
+  manual-reset event is not affected by acquisition.
+
+  Acquisition is atomic and totally ordered with respect to other
+  operations on the same object. If two wait operations (with
+  different ``owner`` identifiers) are queued on the same mutex, only
+  one is signaled. If two wait operations are queued on the same
+  semaphore, and a value of one is posted to it, only one is signaled.
+  The order in which threads are signaled is not specified.
+
+  If an inconsistent mutex is acquired, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. Although this is a failure return, the function may
+  otherwise be considered successful. The mutex is marked as owned by
+  the given owner (with a recursion count of 1) and as no longer
+  inconsistent, and ``index`` is still set to the index of the mutex.
+
+  The ``alert`` argument is an "extra" event which can terminate the
+  wait, independently of all other objects. If members of ``objs`` and
+  ``alert`` are both simultaneously signaled, a member of ``objs``
+  will always be given priority and acquired first. Aside from this,
+  for "any" waits, there is no difference between passing an event as
+  this parameter, and passing it as an additional object at the end of
+  the ``objs`` array. For "all" waits, there is an additional
+  difference, as described below.
+
+  It is valid to pass the same object more than once, including by
+  passing the same event in the ``objs`` array and in ``alert``. If a
+  wakeup occurs due to that object being signaled, ``index`` is set to
+  the lowest index corresponding to that object.
+
+  The function may fail with ``EINTR`` if a signal is received.
+
+.. c:macro:: WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ALL
+
+  Poll on a list of objects, atomically acquiring all of them. Takes a
+  pointer to struct :c:type:`winesync_wait_args`, which is used
+  identically to ``WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, except that ``index`` is
+  always filled with zero on success if not woken via alert.
+
+  This function attempts to simultaneously acquire all of the given
+  objects. If unable to do so, it sleeps until all objects become
+  simultaneously signaled, subsequently acquiring them, or the timeout
+  expires. In the latter case the ioctl fails with ``ETIMEDOUT`` and
+  no objects are modified.
+
+  Objects may become signaled and subsequently designaled (through
+  acquisition by other threads) while this thread is sleeping. Only
+  once all objects are simultaneously signaled does the ioctl acquire
+  them and return. The entire acquisition is atomic and totally
+  ordered with respect to other operations on any of the given
+  objects.
+
+  If an inconsistent mutex is acquired, the ioctl fails with
+  ``EOWNERDEAD``. Similarly to ``WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, all objects
+  are nevertheless marked as acquired. Note that if multiple mutex
+  objects are specified, there is no way to know which were marked as
+  inconsistent.
+
+  As with "any" waits, the ``alert`` argument is an "extra" event
+  which can terminate the wait. Critically, however, an "all" wait
+  will succeed if all members in ``objs`` are signaled, *or* if
+  ``alert`` is signaled. In the latter case ``index`` will be set to
+  ``count``. As with "any" waits, if both conditions are filled, the
+  former takes priority, and objects in ``objs`` will be acquired.
+
+  Unlike ``WINESYNC_IOC_WAIT_ANY``, it is not valid to pass the same
+  object more than once, nor is it valid to pass the same object in
+  ``objs`` and in ``alert`` If this is attempted, the function fails
+  with ``EINVAL``.
