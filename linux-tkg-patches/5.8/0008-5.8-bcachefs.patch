-/*
- * Closure is perhaps the most overused and abused term in computer science, but
- * since I've been unable to come up with anything better you're stuck with it
- * again.
- *
- * What are closures?
- *
- * They embed a refcount. The basic idea is they count "things that are in
- * progress" - in flight bios, some other thread that's doing something else -
- * anything you might want to wait on.
- *
- * The refcount may be manipulated with closure_get() and closure_put().
- * closure_put() is where many of the interesting things happen, when it causes
- * the refcount to go to 0.
- *
- * Closures can be used to wait on things both synchronously and asynchronously,
- * and synchronous and asynchronous use can be mixed without restriction. To
- * wait synchronously, use closure_sync() - you will sleep until your closure's
- * refcount hits 1.
- *
- * To wait asynchronously, use
- *   continue_at(cl, next_function, workqueue);
- *
- * passing it, as you might expect, the function to run when nothing is pending
- * and the workqueue to run that function out of.
- *
- * continue_at() also, critically, requires a 'return' immediately following the
- * location where this macro is referenced, to return to the calling function.
- * There's good reason for this.
- *
- * To use safely closures asynchronously, they must always have a refcount while
- * they are running owned by the thread that is running them. Otherwise, suppose
- * you submit some bios and wish to have a function run when they all complete:
- *
- * foo_endio(struct bio *bio)
- * {
- *	closure_put(cl);
- * }
- *
- * closure_init(cl);
- *
- * do_stuff();
- * closure_get(cl);
- * bio1->bi_endio = foo_endio;
- * bio_submit(bio1);
- *
- * do_more_stuff();
- * closure_get(cl);
- * bio2->bi_endio = foo_endio;
- * bio_submit(bio2);
- *
- * continue_at(cl, complete_some_read, system_wq);
- *
- * If closure's refcount started at 0, complete_some_read() could run before the
- * second bio was submitted - which is almost always not what you want! More
- * importantly, it wouldn't be possible to say whether the original thread or
- * complete_some_read()'s thread owned the closure - and whatever state it was
- * associated with!
- *
- * So, closure_init() initializes a closure's refcount to 1 - and when a
- * closure_fn is run, the refcount will be reset to 1 first.
- *
- * Then, the rule is - if you got the refcount with closure_get(), release it
- * with closure_put() (i.e, in a bio->bi_endio function). If you have a refcount
- * on a closure because you called closure_init() or you were run out of a
- * closure - _always_ use continue_at(). Doing so consistently will help
- * eliminate an entire class of particularly pernicious races.
- *
- * Lastly, you might have a wait list dedicated to a specific event, and have no
- * need for specifying the condition - you just want to wait until someone runs
- * closure_wake_up() on the appropriate wait list. In that case, just use
- * closure_wait(). It will return either true or false, depending on whether the
- * closure was already on a wait list or not - a closure can only be on one wait
- * list at a time.
- *
- * Parents:
- *
- * closure_init() takes two arguments - it takes the closure to initialize, and
- * a (possibly null) parent.
- *
- * If parent is non null, the new closure will have a refcount for its lifetime;
- * a closure is considered to be "finished" when its refcount hits 0 and the
- * function to run is null. Hence
- *
- * continue_at(cl, NULL, NULL);
- *
- * returns up the (spaghetti) stack of closures, precisely like normal return
- * returns up the C stack. continue_at() with non null fn is better thought of
- * as doing a tail call.
- *
- * All this implies that a closure should typically be embedded in a particular
- * struct (which its refcount will normally control the lifetime of), and that
- * struct can very much be thought of as a stack frame.

+ * Primary bucket allocation code
+ *
+ * Copyright 2012 Google, Inc.
+ *
+ * Allocation in bcache is done in terms of buckets:
+ *
+ * Each bucket has associated an 8 bit gen; this gen corresponds to the gen in
+ * btree pointers - they must match for the pointer to be considered valid.
+ *
+ * Thus (assuming a bucket has no dirty data or metadata in it) we can reuse a
+ * bucket simply by incrementing its gen.
+ *
+ * The gens (along with the priorities; it's really the gens are important but
+ * the code is named as if it's the priorities) are written in an arbitrary list
+ * of buckets on disk, with a pointer to them in the journal header.
+ *
+ * When we invalidate a bucket, we have to write its new gen to disk and wait
+ * for that write to complete before we use it - otherwise after a crash we
+ * could have pointers that appeared to be good but pointed to data that had
+ * been overwritten.
+ *
+ * Since the gens and priorities are all stored contiguously on disk, we can
+ * batch this up: We fill up the free_inc list with freshly invalidated buckets,
+ * call prio_write(), and when prio_write() finishes we pull buckets off the
+ * free_inc list and optionally discard them.
+ *
+ * free_inc isn't the only freelist - if it was, we'd often have to sleep while
+ * priorities and gens were being written before we could allocate. c->free is a
+ * smaller freelist, and buckets on that list are always ready to be used.
+ *
+ * If we've got discards enabled, that happens when a bucket moves from the
+ * free_inc list to the free list.
+ *
+ * It's important to ensure that gens don't wrap around - with respect to
+ * either the oldest gen in the btree or the gen on disk. This is quite
+ * difficult to do in practice, but we explicitly guard against it anyways - if
+ * a bucket is in danger of wrapping around we simply skip invalidating it that
+ * time around, and we garbage collect or rewrite the priorities sooner than we
+ * would have otherwise.
+ *
+ * bch2_bucket_alloc() allocates a single bucket from a specific device.
+ *
+ * bch2_bucket_alloc_set() allocates one or more buckets from different devices
+ * in a given filesystem.
+ *
+ * invalidate_buckets() drives all the processes described above. It's called
+ * from bch2_bucket_alloc() and a few other places that need to make sure free
+ * buckets are ready.
+ *
+ * invalidate_buckets_(lru|fifo)() find buckets that are available to be
+ * invalidated, and then invalidate them and stick them on the free_inc list -
+ * in either lru or fifo order.

+ * SOME HIGH LEVEL CODE DOCUMENTATION:
+ *
+ * Bcache mostly works with cache sets, cache devices, and backing devices.
+ *
+ * Support for multiple cache devices hasn't quite been finished off yet, but
+ * it's about 95% plumbed through. A cache set and its cache devices is sort of
+ * like a md raid array and its component devices. Most of the code doesn't care
+ * about individual cache devices, the main abstraction is the cache set.
+ *
+ * Multiple cache devices is intended to give us the ability to mirror dirty
+ * cached data and metadata, without mirroring clean cached data.
+ *
+ * Backing devices are different, in that they have a lifetime independent of a
+ * cache set. When you register a newly formatted backing device it'll come up
+ * in passthrough mode, and then you can attach and detach a backing device from
+ * a cache set at runtime - while it's mounted and in use. Detaching implicitly
+ * invalidates any cached data for that backing device.
+ *
+ * A cache set can have multiple (many) backing devices attached to it.
+ *
+ * There's also flash only volumes - this is the reason for the distinction
+ * between struct cached_dev and struct bcache_device. A flash only volume
+ * works much like a bcache device that has a backing device, except the
+ * "cached" data is always dirty. The end result is that we get thin
+ * provisioning with very little additional code.
+ *
+ * Flash only volumes work but they're not production ready because the moving
+ * garbage collector needs more work. More on that later.
+ *
+ * BUCKETS/ALLOCATION:
+ *
+ * Bcache is primarily designed for caching, which means that in normal
+ * operation all of our available space will be allocated. Thus, we need an
+ * efficient way of deleting things from the cache so we can write new things to
+ * it.
+ *
+ * To do this, we first divide the cache device up into buckets. A bucket is the
+ * unit of allocation; they're typically around 1 mb - anywhere from 128k to 2M+
+ * works efficiently.
+ *
+ * Each bucket has a 16 bit priority, and an 8 bit generation associated with
+ * it. The gens and priorities for all the buckets are stored contiguously and
+ * packed on disk (in a linked list of buckets - aside from the superblock, all
+ * of bcache's metadata is stored in buckets).
+ *
+ * The priority is used to implement an LRU. We reset a bucket's priority when
+ * we allocate it or on cache it, and every so often we decrement the priority
+ * of each bucket. It could be used to implement something more sophisticated,
+ * if anyone ever gets around to it.
+ *
+ * The generation is used for invalidating buckets. Each pointer also has an 8
+ * bit generation embedded in it; for a pointer to be considered valid, its gen
+ * must match the gen of the bucket it points into.  Thus, to reuse a bucket all
+ * we have to do is increment its gen (and write its new gen to disk; we batch
+ * this up).
+ *
+ * Bcache is entirely COW - we never write twice to a bucket, even buckets that
+ * contain metadata (including btree nodes).
+ *
+ * THE BTREE:
+ *
+ * Bcache is in large part design around the btree.
+ *
+ * At a high level, the btree is just an index of key -> ptr tuples.
+ *
+ * Keys represent extents, and thus have a size field. Keys also have a variable
+ * number of pointers attached to them (potentially zero, which is handy for
+ * invalidating the cache).
+ *
+ * The key itself is an inode:offset pair. The inode number corresponds to a
+ * backing device or a flash only volume. The offset is the ending offset of the
+ * extent within the inode - not the starting offset; this makes lookups
+ * slightly more convenient.
+ *
+ * Pointers contain the cache device id, the offset on that device, and an 8 bit
+ * generation number. More on the gen later.
+ *
+ * Index lookups are not fully abstracted - cache lookups in particular are
+ * still somewhat mixed in with the btree code, but things are headed in that
+ * direction.
+ *
+ * Updates are fairly well abstracted, though. There are two different ways of
+ * updating the btree; insert and replace.
+ *
+ * BTREE_INSERT will just take a list of keys and insert them into the btree -
+ * overwriting (possibly only partially) any extents they overlap with. This is
+ * used to update the index after a write.
+ *
+ * BTREE_REPLACE is really cmpxchg(); it inserts a key into the btree iff it is
+ * overwriting a key that matches another given key. This is used for inserting
+ * data into the cache after a cache miss, and for background writeback, and for
+ * the moving garbage collector.
+ *
+ * There is no "delete" operation; deleting things from the index is
+ * accomplished by either by invalidating pointers (by incrementing a bucket's
+ * gen) or by inserting a key with 0 pointers - which will overwrite anything
+ * previously present at that location in the index.
+ *
+ * This means that there are always stale/invalid keys in the btree. They're
+ * filtered out by the code that iterates through a btree node, and removed when
+ * a btree node is rewritten.
+ *
+ * BTREE NODES:
+ *
+ * Our unit of allocation is a bucket, and we we can't arbitrarily allocate and
+ * free smaller than a bucket - so, that's how big our btree nodes are.
+ *
+ * (If buckets are really big we'll only use part of the bucket for a btree node
+ * - no less than 1/4th - but a bucket still contains no more than a single
+ * btree node. I'd actually like to change this, but for now we rely on the
+ * bucket's gen for deleting btree nodes when we rewrite/split a node.)
+ *
+ * Anyways, btree nodes are big - big enough to be inefficient with a textbook
+ * btree implementation.
+ *
+ * The way this is solved is that btree nodes are internally log structured; we
+ * can append new keys to an existing btree node without rewriting it. This
+ * means each set of keys we write is sorted, but the node is not.
+ *
+ * We maintain this log structure in memory - keeping 1Mb of keys sorted would
+ * be expensive, and we have to distinguish between the keys we have written and
+ * the keys we haven't. So to do a lookup in a btree node, we have to search
+ * each sorted set. But we do merge written sets together lazily, so the cost of
+ * these extra searches is quite low (normally most of the keys in a btree node
+ * will be in one big set, and then there'll be one or two sets that are much
+ * smaller).
+ *
+ * This log structure makes bcache's btree more of a hybrid between a
+ * conventional btree and a compacting data structure, with some of the
+ * advantages of both.
+ *
+ * GARBAGE COLLECTION:
+ *
+ * We can't just invalidate any bucket - it might contain dirty data or
+ * metadata. If it once contained dirty data, other writes might overwrite it
+ * later, leaving no valid pointers into that bucket in the index.
+ *
+ * Thus, the primary purpose of garbage collection is to find buckets to reuse.
+ * It also counts how much valid data it each bucket currently contains, so that
+ * allocation can reuse buckets sooner when they've been mostly overwritten.
+ *
+ * It also does some things that are really internal to the btree
+ * implementation. If a btree node contains pointers that are stale by more than
+ * some threshold, it rewrites the btree node to avoid the bucket's generation
+ * wrapping around. It also merges adjacent btree nodes if they're empty enough.
+ *
+ * THE JOURNAL:
+ *
+ * Bcache's journal is not necessary for consistency; we always strictly
+ * order metadata writes so that the btree and everything else is consistent on
+ * disk in the event of an unclean shutdown, and in fact bcache had writeback
+ * caching (with recovery from unclean shutdown) before journalling was
+ * implemented.
+ *
+ * Rather, the journal is purely a performance optimization; we can't complete a
+ * write until we've updated the index on disk, otherwise the cache would be
+ * inconsistent in the event of an unclean shutdown. This means that without the
+ * journal, on random write workloads we constantly have to update all the leaf
+ * nodes in the btree, and those writes will be mostly empty (appending at most
+ * a few keys each) - highly inefficient in terms of amount of metadata writes,
+ * and it puts more strain on the various btree resorting/compacting code.
+ *
+ * The journal is just a log of keys we've inserted; on startup we just reinsert
+ * all the keys in the open journal entries. That means that when we're updating
+ * a node in the btree, we can wait until a 4k block of keys fills up before
+ * writing them out.
+ *
+ * For simplicity, we only journal updates to leaf nodes; updates to parent
+ * nodes are rare enough (since our leaf nodes are huge) that it wasn't worth
+ * the complexity to deal with journalling them (in particular, journal replay)
+ * - updates to non leaf nodes just happen synchronously (see btree_split()).

+/*
+ * bcachefs on disk data structures
+ *
+ * OVERVIEW:
+ *
+ * There are three main types of on disk data structures in bcachefs (this is
+ * reduced from 5 in bcache)
+ *
+ *  - superblock
+ *  - journal
+ *  - btree
+ *
+ * The btree is the primary structure; most metadata exists as keys in the
+ * various btrees. There are only a small number of btrees, they're not
+ * sharded - we have one btree for extents, another for inodes, et cetera.
+ *
+ * SUPERBLOCK:
+ *
+ * The superblock contains the location of the journal, the list of devices in
+ * the filesystem, and in general any metadata we need in order to decide
+ * whether we can start a filesystem or prior to reading the journal/btree
+ * roots.
+ *
+ * The superblock is extensible, and most of the contents of the superblock are
+ * in variable length, type tagged fields; see struct bch_sb_field.
+ *
+ * Backup superblocks do not reside in a fixed location; also, superblocks do
+ * not have a fixed size. To locate backup superblocks we have struct
+ * bch_sb_layout; we store a copy of this inside every superblock, and also
+ * before the first superblock.
+ *
+ * JOURNAL:
+ *
+ * The journal primarily records btree updates in the order they occurred;
+ * journal replay consists of just iterating over all the keys in the open
+ * journal entries and re-inserting them into the btrees.
+ *
+ * The journal also contains entry types for the btree roots, and blacklisted
+ * journal sequence numbers (see journal_seq_blacklist.c).
+ *
+ * BTREE:
+ *
+ * bcachefs btrees are copy on write b+ trees, where nodes are big (typically
+ * 128k-256k) and log structured. We use struct btree_node for writing the first
+ * entry in a given node (offset 0), and struct btree_node_entry for all
+ * subsequent writes.
+ *
+ * After the header, btree node entries contain a list of keys in sorted order.
+ * Values are stored inline with the keys; since values are variable length (and
+ * keys effectively are variable length too, due to packing) we can't do random
+ * access without building up additional in memory tables in the btree node read
+ * path.
+ *
+ * BTREE KEYS (struct bkey):
+ *
+ * The various btrees share a common format for the key - so as to avoid
+ * switching in fastpath lookup/comparison code - but define their own
+ * structures for the key values.
+ *
+ * The size of a key/value pair is stored as a u8 in units of u64s, so the max
+ * size is just under 2k. The common part also contains a type tag for the
+ * value, and a format field indicating whether the key is packed or not (and
+ * also meant to allow adding new key fields in the future, if desired).
+ *
+ * bkeys, when stored within a btree node, may also be packed. In that case, the
+ * bkey_format in that node is used to unpack it. Packed bkeys mean that we can
+ * be generous with field sizes in the common part of the key format (64 bit
+ * inode number, 64 bit offset, 96 bit version field, etc.) for negligible cost.

+
+/*
+ * In extent bkeys, the value is a list of pointers (bch_extent_ptr), optionally
+ * preceded by checksum/compression information (bch_extent_crc32 or
+ * bch_extent_crc64).
+ *
+ * One major determining factor in the format of extents is how we handle and
+ * represent extents that have been partially overwritten and thus trimmed:
+ *
+ * If an extent is not checksummed or compressed, when the extent is trimmed we
+ * don't have to remember the extent we originally allocated and wrote: we can
+ * merely adjust ptr->offset to point to the start of the data that is currently
+ * live. The size field in struct bkey records the current (live) size of the
+ * extent, and is also used to mean "size of region on disk that we point to" in
+ * this case.
+ *
+ * Thus an extent that is not checksummed or compressed will consist only of a
+ * list of bch_extent_ptrs, with none of the fields in
+ * bch_extent_crc32/bch_extent_crc64.
+ *
+ * When an extent is checksummed or compressed, it's not possible to read only
+ * the data that is currently live: we have to read the entire extent that was
+ * originally written, and then return only the part of the extent that is
+ * currently live.
+ *
+ * Thus, in addition to the current size of the extent in struct bkey, we need
+ * to store the size of the originally allocated space - this is the
+ * compressed_size and uncompressed_size fields in bch_extent_crc32/64. Also,
+ * when the extent is trimmed, instead of modifying the offset field of the
+ * pointer, we keep a second smaller offset field - "offset into the original
+ * extent of the currently live region".
+ *
+ * The other major determining factor is replication and data migration:
+ *
+ * Each pointer may have its own bch_extent_crc32/64. When doing a replicated
+ * write, we will initially write all the replicas in the same format, with the
+ * same checksum type and compression format - however, when copygc runs later (or
+ * tiering/cache promotion, anything that moves data), it is not in general
+ * going to rewrite all the pointers at once - one of the replicas may be in a
+ * bucket on one device that has very little fragmentation while another lives
+ * in a bucket that has become heavily fragmented, and thus is being rewritten
+ * sooner than the rest.
+ *
+ * Thus it will only move a subset of the pointers (or in the case of
+ * tiering/cache promotion perhaps add a single pointer without dropping any
+ * current pointers), and if the extent has been partially overwritten it must
+ * write only the currently live portion (or copygc would not be able to reduce
+ * fragmentation!) - which necessitates a different bch_extent_crc format for
+ * the new pointer.
+ *
+ * But in the interests of space efficiency, we don't want to store one
+ * bch_extent_crc for each pointer if we don't have to.
+ *
+ * Thus, a bch_extent consists of bch_extent_crc32s, bch_extent_crc64s, and
+ * bch_extent_ptrs appended arbitrarily one after the other. We determine the
+ * type of a given entry with a scheme similar to utf8 (except we're encoding a
+ * type, not a size), encoding the type in the position of the first set bit:
+ *
+ * bch_extent_crc32	- 0b1
+ * bch_extent_ptr	- 0b10
+ * bch_extent_crc64	- 0b100
+ *
+ * We do it this way because bch_extent_crc32 is _very_ constrained on bits (and
+ * bch_extent_crc64 is the least constrained).
+ *
+ * Then, each bch_extent_crc32/64 applies to the pointers that follow after it,
+ * until the next bch_extent_crc32/64.
+ *
+ * If there are no bch_extent_crcs preceding a bch_extent_ptr, then that pointer
+ * is neither checksummed nor compressed.

+ *
+ * Some adjacent keys with a string of equal keys:
+ *	i j k k k k l m
+ *
+ * If you search for k, the lookup code isn't guaranteed to return you any
+ * specific k. The lookup code is conceptually doing a binary search and
+ * iterating backwards is very expensive so if the pivot happens to land at the
+ * last k that's what you'll get.
+ *
+ * This works out ok, but it's something to be aware of:
+ *
+ *  - For non extents, we guarantee that the live key comes last - see
+ *    btree_node_iter_cmp(), keys_out_of_order(). So the duplicates you don't
+ *    see will only be deleted keys you don't care about.
+ *
+ *  - For extents, deleted keys sort last (see the comment at the top of this
+ *    file). But when you're searching for extents, you actually want the first
+ *    key strictly greater than your search key - an extent that compares equal
+ *    to the search key is going to have 0 sectors after the search key.
+ *
+ *    But this does mean that we can't just search for
+ *    bkey_successor(start_of_range) to get the first extent that overlaps with
+ *    the range we want - if we're unlucky and there's an extent that ends
+ *    exactly where we searched, then there could be a deleted key at the same
+ *    position and we'd get that when we search instead of the preceding extent
+ *    we needed.
+ *
+ *    So we've got to search for start_of_range, then after the lookup iterate
+ *    past any extents that compare equal to the position we searched for.

+ * BKEYS:
+ *
+ * A bkey contains a key, a size field, a variable number of pointers, and some
+ * ancillary flag bits.
+ *
+ * We use two different functions for validating bkeys, bkey_invalid and
+ * bkey_deleted().
+ *
+ * The one exception to the rule that ptr_invalid() filters out invalid keys is
+ * that it also filters out keys of size 0 - these are keys that have been
+ * completely overwritten. It'd be safe to delete these in memory while leaving
+ * them on disk, just unnecessary work - so we filter them out when resorting
+ * instead.
+ *
+ * We can't filter out stale keys when we're resorting, because garbage
+ * collection needs to find them to ensure bucket gens don't wrap around -
+ * unless we're rewriting the btree node those stale keys still exist on disk.
+ *
+ * We also implement functions here for removing some number of sectors from the
+ * front or the back of a bkey - this is mainly used for fixing overlapping
+ * extents, by removing the overlapping sectors from the older key.
+ *
+ * BSETS:
+ *
+ * A bset is an array of bkeys laid out contiguously in memory in sorted order,
+ * along with a header. A btree node is made up of a number of these, written at
+ * different times.
+ *
+ * There could be many of them on disk, but we never allow there to be more than
+ * 4 in memory - we lazily resort as needed.
+ *
+ * We implement code here for creating and maintaining auxiliary search trees
+ * (described below) for searching an individial bset, and on top of that we
+ * implement a btree iterator.
+ *
+ * BTREE ITERATOR:
+ *
+ * Most of the code in bcache doesn't care about an individual bset - it needs
+ * to search entire btree nodes and iterate over them in sorted order.
+ *
+ * The btree iterator code serves both functions; it iterates through the keys
+ * in a btree node in sorted order, starting from either keys after a specific
+ * point (if you pass it a search key) or the start of the btree node.
+ *
+ * AUXILIARY SEARCH TREES:
+ *
+ * Since keys are variable length, we can't use a binary search on a bset - we
+ * wouldn't be able to find the start of the next key. But binary searches are
+ * slow anyways, due to terrible cache behaviour; bcache originally used binary
+ * searches and that code topped out at under 50k lookups/second.
+ *
+ * So we need to construct some sort of lookup table. Since we only insert keys
+ * into the last (unwritten) set, most of the keys within a given btree node are
+ * usually in sets that are mostly constant. We use two different types of
+ * lookup tables to take advantage of this.
+ *
+ * Both lookup tables share in common that they don't index every key in the
+ * set; they index one key every BSET_CACHELINE bytes, and then a linear search
+ * is used for the rest.
+ *
+ * For sets that have been written to disk and are no longer being inserted
+ * into, we construct a binary search tree in an array - traversing a binary
+ * search tree in an array gives excellent locality of reference and is very
+ * fast, since both children of any node are adjacent to each other in memory
+ * (and their grandchildren, and great grandchildren...) - this means
+ * prefetching can be used to great effect.
+ *
+ * It's quite useful performance wise to keep these nodes small - not just
+ * because they're more likely to be in L2, but also because we can prefetch
+ * more nodes on a single cacheline and thus prefetch more iterations in advance
+ * when traversing this tree.
+ *
+ * Nodes in the auxiliary search tree must contain both a key to compare against
+ * (we don't want to fetch the key from the set, that would defeat the purpose),
+ * and a pointer to the key. We use a few tricks to compress both of these.
+ *
+ * To compress the pointer, we take advantage of the fact that one node in the
+ * search tree corresponds to precisely BSET_CACHELINE bytes in the set. We have
+ * a function (to_inorder()) that takes the index of a node in a binary tree and
+ * returns what its index would be in an inorder traversal, so we only have to
+ * store the low bits of the offset.
+ *
+ * The key is 84 bits (KEY_DEV + key->key, the offset on the device). To
+ * compress that,  we take advantage of the fact that when we're traversing the
+ * search tree at every iteration we know that both our search key and the key
+ * we're looking for lie within some range - bounded by our previous
+ * comparisons. (We special case the start of a search so that this is true even
+ * at the root of the tree).
+ *
+ * So we know the key we're looking for is between a and b, and a and b don't
+ * differ higher than bit 50, we don't need to check anything higher than bit
+ * 50.
+ *
+ * We don't usually need the rest of the bits, either; we only need enough bits
+ * to partition the key range we're currently checking.  Consider key n - the
+ * key our auxiliary search tree node corresponds to, and key p, the key
+ * immediately preceding n.  The lowest bit we need to store in the auxiliary
+ * search tree is the highest bit that differs between n and p.
+ *
+ * Note that this could be bit 0 - we might sometimes need all 80 bits to do the
+ * comparison. But we'd really like our nodes in the auxiliary search tree to be
+ * of fixed size.
+ *
+ * The solution is to make them fixed size, and when we're constructing a node
+ * check if p and n differed in the bits we needed them to. If they don't we
+ * flag that node, and when doing lookups we fallback to comparing against the
+ * real key. As long as this doesn't happen to often (and it seems to reliably
+ * happen a bit less than 1% of the time), we win - even on failures, that key
+ * is then more likely to be in cache than if we were doing binary searches all
+ * the way, since we're touching so much less memory.
+ *
+ * The keys in the auxiliary search tree are stored in (software) floating
+ * point, with an exponent and a mantissa. The exponent needs to be big enough
+ * to address all the bits in the original key, but the number of bits in the
+ * mantissa is somewhat arbitrary; more bits just gets us fewer failures.
+ *
+ * We need 7 bits for the exponent and 3 bits for the key's offset (since keys
+ * are 8 byte aligned); using 22 bits for the mantissa means a node is 4 bytes.
+ * We need one node per 128 bytes in the btree node, which means the auxiliary
+ * search trees take up 3% as much memory as the btree itself.
+ *
+ * Constructing these auxiliary search trees is moderately expensive, and we
+ * don't want to be constantly rebuilding the search tree for the last set
+ * whenever we insert another key into it. For the unwritten set, we use a much
+ * simpler lookup table - it's just a flat array, so index i in the lookup table
+ * corresponds to the i range of BSET_CACHELINE bytes in the set. Indexing
+ * within each byte range works the same as with the auxiliary search trees.
+ *
+ * These are much easier to keep up to date when we insert a key - we do it
+ * somewhat lazily; when we shift a key up we usually just increment the pointer
+ * to it, only when it would overflow do we go to the trouble of finding the
+ * first key in that range of bytes again.

+ * Bucket states:

+ *   The bucket contains no data and will not be read

+ * - allocator bucket: owned_by_allocator == 1
+ *   The bucket is on a free list, or it is an open bucket

+ *                  cached_sectors > 0
+ *   The bucket contains data but may be safely discarded as there are

+ *   written back to the backing device
+ *
+ * - dirty bucket: owned_by_allocator == 0 &&
+ *                 dirty_sectors > 0
+ *   The bucket contains data that we must not discard (either only copy,
+ *   or one of the 'main copies' for data requiring multiple replicas)
+ *
+ * - metadata bucket: owned_by_allocator == 0 && is_metadata == 1
+ *   This is a btree node, journal or gen/prio bucket

+ *
+ * bucket invalidated => bucket on freelist => open bucket =>
+ *     [dirty bucket =>] cached bucket => bucket invalidated => ...
+ *
+ * Note that cache promotion can skip the dirty bucket step, as data

+ * bucket.
+ * Note also that a cached bucket can spontaneously become dirty --
+ * see below.
+ *
+ * Only a traversal of the key space can determine whether a bucket is
+ * truly dirty or cached.
+ *
+ * Transitions:
+ *
+ * - free => allocator: bucket was invalidated
+ * - cached => allocator: bucket was invalidated
+ *
+ * - allocator => dirty: open bucket was filled up
+ * - allocator => cached: open bucket was filled up
+ * - allocator => metadata: metadata was allocated
+ *
+ * - dirty => cached: dirty sectors were copied to a deeper tier
+ * - dirty => free: dirty sectors were overwritten or moved (copy gc)
+ * - cached => free: cached sectors were overwritten
+ *
+ * - metadata => free: metadata was freed
+ *
+ * Oddities:
+ * - cached => dirty: a device was removed so formerly replicated data
+ *                    is no longer sufficiently replicated
+ * - free => cached: cannot happen
+ * - free => dirty: cannot happen
+ * - free => metadata: cannot happen

+/*
+ * THE JOURNAL:
+ *
+ * The primary purpose of the journal is to log updates (insertions) to the
+ * b-tree, to avoid having to do synchronous updates to the b-tree on disk.
+ *
+ * Without the journal, the b-tree is always internally consistent on
+ * disk - and in fact, in the earliest incarnations bcache didn't have a journal
+ * but did handle unclean shutdowns by doing all index updates synchronously
+ * (with coalescing).
+ *
+ * Updates to interior nodes still happen synchronously and without the journal
+ * (for simplicity) - this may change eventually but updates to interior nodes
+ * are rare enough it's not a huge priority.
+ *
+ * This means the journal is relatively separate from the b-tree; it consists of
+ * just a list of keys and journal replay consists of just redoing those
+ * insertions in same order that they appear in the journal.
+ *
+ * PERSISTENCE:
+ *
+ * For synchronous updates (where we're waiting on the index update to hit
+ * disk), the journal entry will be written out immediately (or as soon as
+ * possible, if the write for the previous journal entry was still in flight).
+ *
+ * Synchronous updates are specified by passing a closure (@flush_cl) to
+ * bch2_btree_insert() or bch_btree_insert_node(), which then pass that parameter
+ * down to the journalling code. That closure will will wait on the journal
+ * write to complete (via closure_wait()).
+ *
+ * If the index update wasn't synchronous, the journal entry will be
+ * written out after 10 ms have elapsed, by default (the delay_ms field
+ * in struct journal).
+ *
+ * JOURNAL ENTRIES:
+ *
+ * A journal entry is variable size (struct jset), it's got a fixed length
+ * header and then a variable number of struct jset_entry entries.
+ *
+ * Journal entries are identified by monotonically increasing 64 bit sequence
+ * numbers - jset->seq; other places in the code refer to this sequence number.
+ *
+ * A jset_entry entry contains one or more bkeys (which is what gets inserted
+ * into the b-tree). We need a container to indicate which b-tree the key is
+ * for; also, the roots of the various b-trees are stored in jset_entry entries
+ * (one for each b-tree) - this lets us add new b-tree types without changing
+ * the on disk format.
+ *
+ * We also keep some things in the journal header that are logically part of the
+ * superblock - all the things that are frequently updated. This is for future
+ * bcache on raw flash support; the superblock (which will become another
+ * journal) can't be moved or wear leveled, so it contains just enough
+ * information to find the main journal, and the superblock only has to be
+ * rewritten when we want to move/wear level the main journal.
+ *
+ * JOURNAL LAYOUT ON DISK:
+ *
+ * The journal is written to a ringbuffer of buckets (which is kept in the
+ * superblock); the individual buckets are not necessarily contiguous on disk
+ * which means that journal entries are not allowed to span buckets, but also
+ * that we can resize the journal at runtime if desired (unimplemented).
+ *
+ * The journal buckets exist in the same pool as all the other buckets that are
+ * managed by the allocator and garbage collection - garbage collection marks
+ * the journal buckets as metadata buckets.
+ *
+ * OPEN/DIRTY JOURNAL ENTRIES:
+ *
+ * Open/dirty journal entries are journal entries that contain b-tree updates
+ * that have not yet been written out to the b-tree on disk. We have to track
+ * which journal entries are dirty, and we also have to avoid wrapping around
+ * the journal and overwriting old but still dirty journal entries with new
+ * journal entries.
+ *
+ * On disk, this is represented with the "last_seq" field of struct jset;
+ * last_seq is the first sequence number that journal replay has to replay.
+ *
+ * To avoid overwriting dirty journal entries on disk, we keep a mapping (in
+ * journal_device->seq) of for each journal bucket, the highest sequence number
+ * any journal entry it contains. Then, by comparing that against last_seq we
+ * can determine whether that journal bucket contains dirty journal entries or
+ * not.
+ *
+ * To track which journal entries are dirty, we maintain a fifo of refcounts
+ * (where each entry corresponds to a specific sequence number) - when a ref
+ * goes to 0, that journal entry is no longer dirty.
+ *
+ * Journalling of index updates is done at the same time as the b-tree itself is
+ * being modified (see btree_insert_key()); when we add the key to the journal
+ * the pending b-tree write takes a ref on the journal entry the key was added
+ * to. If a pending b-tree write would need to take refs on multiple dirty
+ * journal entries, it only keeps the ref on the oldest one (since a newer
+ * journal entry will still be replayed if an older entry was dirty).
+ *
+ * JOURNAL FILLING UP:
+ *
+ * There are two ways the journal could fill up; either we could run out of
+ * space to write to, or we could have too many open journal entries and run out
+ * of room in the fifo of refcounts. Since those refcounts are decremented
+ * without any locking we can't safely resize that fifo, so we handle it the
+ * same way.
+ *
+ * If the journal fills up, we start flushing dirty btree nodes until we can
+ * allocate space for a journal write again - preferentially flushing btree
+ * nodes that are pinning the oldest journal entries first.

+ * journal_seq_blacklist machinery:
+ *
+ * To guarantee order of btree updates after a crash, we need to detect when a
+ * btree node entry (bset) is newer than the newest journal entry that was
+ * successfully written, and ignore it - effectively ignoring any btree updates
+ * that didn't make it into the journal.
+ *
+ * If we didn't do this, we might have two btree nodes, a and b, both with
+ * updates that weren't written to the journal yet: if b was updated after a,
+ * but b was flushed and not a - oops; on recovery we'll find that the updates
+ * to b happened, but not the updates to a that happened before it.
+ *
+ * Ignoring bsets that are newer than the newest journal entry is always safe,
+ * because everything they contain will also have been journalled - and must
+ * still be present in the journal on disk until a journal entry has been
+ * written _after_ that bset was written.
+ *
+ * To accomplish this, bsets record the newest journal sequence number they
+ * contain updates for; then, on startup, the btree code queries the journal
+ * code to ask "Is this sequence number newer than the newest journal entry? If
+ * so, ignore it."
+ *
+ * When this happens, we must blacklist that journal sequence number: the
+ * journal must not write any entries with that sequence number, and it must
+ * record that it was blacklisted so that a) on recovery we don't think we have
+ * missing journal entries and b) so that the btree code continues to ignore
+ * that bset, until that btree node is rewritten.

+/*
+ * Closure is perhaps the most overused and abused term in computer science, but
+ * since I've been unable to come up with anything better you're stuck with it
+ * again.
+ *
+ * What are closures?
+ *
+ * They embed a refcount. The basic idea is they count "things that are in
+ * progress" - in flight bios, some other thread that's doing something else -
+ * anything you might want to wait on.
+ *
+ * The refcount may be manipulated with closure_get() and closure_put().
+ * closure_put() is where many of the interesting things happen, when it causes
+ * the refcount to go to 0.
+ *
+ * Closures can be used to wait on things both synchronously and asynchronously,
+ * and synchronous and asynchronous use can be mixed without restriction. To
+ * wait synchronously, use closure_sync() - you will sleep until your closure's
+ * refcount hits 1.
+ *
+ * To wait asynchronously, use
+ *   continue_at(cl, next_function, workqueue);
+ *
+ * passing it, as you might expect, the function to run when nothing is pending
+ * and the workqueue to run that function out of.
+ *
+ * continue_at() also, critically, requires a 'return' immediately following the
+ * location where this macro is referenced, to return to the calling function.
+ * There's good reason for this.
+ *
+ * To use safely closures asynchronously, they must always have a refcount while
+ * they are running owned by the thread that is running them. Otherwise, suppose
+ * you submit some bios and wish to have a function run when they all complete:
+ *
+ * foo_endio(struct bio *bio)
+ * {
+ *	closure_put(cl);
+ * }
+ *
+ * closure_init(cl);
+ *
+ * do_stuff();
+ * closure_get(cl);
+ * bio1->bi_endio = foo_endio;
+ * bio_submit(bio1);
+ *
+ * do_more_stuff();
+ * closure_get(cl);
+ * bio2->bi_endio = foo_endio;
+ * bio_submit(bio2);
+ *
+ * continue_at(cl, complete_some_read, system_wq);
+ *
+ * If closure's refcount started at 0, complete_some_read() could run before the
+ * second bio was submitted - which is almost always not what you want! More
+ * importantly, it wouldn't be possible to say whether the original thread or
+ * complete_some_read()'s thread owned the closure - and whatever state it was
+ * associated with!
+ *
+ * So, closure_init() initializes a closure's refcount to 1 - and when a
+ * closure_fn is run, the refcount will be reset to 1 first.
+ *
+ * Then, the rule is - if you got the refcount with closure_get(), release it
+ * with closure_put() (i.e, in a bio->bi_endio function). If you have a refcount
+ * on a closure because you called closure_init() or you were run out of a
+ * closure - _always_ use continue_at(). Doing so consistently will help
+ * eliminate an entire class of particularly pernicious races.
+ *
+ * Lastly, you might have a wait list dedicated to a specific event, and have no
+ * need for specifying the condition - you just want to wait until someone runs
+ * closure_wake_up() on the appropriate wait list. In that case, just use
+ * closure_wait(). It will return either true or false, depending on whether the
+ * closure was already on a wait list or not - a closure can only be on one wait
+ * list at a time.
+ *
+ * Parents:
+ *
+ * closure_init() takes two arguments - it takes the closure to initialize, and
+ * a (possibly null) parent.
+ *
+ * If parent is non null, the new closure will have a refcount for its lifetime;
+ * a closure is considered to be "finished" when its refcount hits 0 and the
+ * function to run is null. Hence
+ *
+ * continue_at(cl, NULL, NULL);
+ *
+ * returns up the (spaghetti) stack of closures, precisely like normal return
+ * returns up the C stack. continue_at() with non null fn is better thought of
+ * as doing a tail call.
+ *
+ * All this implies that a closure should typically be embedded in a particular
+ * struct (which its refcount will normally control the lifetime of), and that
+ * struct can very much be thought of as a stack frame.
