# linux55-TkG config file


#### MISC OPTIONS #### 

# External config file to use - If the given file exists in path, it will override default config (customization.cfg) - Default is ~/.config/frogminer/linux52-tkg.cfg
_EXT_CONFIG_PATH=~/.config/frogminer/linux55-tkg.cfg

# Set to anything else than "true" to limit cleanup operations and keep source and files generated during compilation.
# Default is "true".
_NUKR="true"

# Custom compiler root dirs - Leave empty to use system compilers
# Example: CUSTOM_GCC_PATH="/home/frog/PKGBUILDS/mostlyportable-gcc/gcc-mostlyportable-9.2.0"
CUSTOM_GCC_PATH=""

# Set to the number corresponding to a predefined profile to use it. Current list of available profiles :
# 1 - Custom (meaning nothing will be enforced and you get to configure everything)
# 2 - Ryzen desktop (performance)
# 3 - Generic Desktop (Performance)
_OPTIPROFILE=""

# Set to true to bypass makepkg.conf and use all available threads for compilation. False will respect your makepkg.conf options.
_force_all_threads="false"

# Set to true to use modprobed db to clean config from unneeded modules. Speeds up compilation considerably. Requires root - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Modprobed-db
# !!!! Make sure to have a well populated db !!!! - Leave empty to be asked about it at build time
_modprobeddb="false"

# Set to "1" to call make menuconfig or "2" to call make nconfig before building the kernel. Set to false to disable and skip the prompt.
_menunconfig=""

# Set to true to generate a kernel config fragment from your changes in menuconfig/nconfig. Set to false to disable and skip the prompt.
_diffconfig=""

# Set to the file name where the generated config fragment should be written to. Only used if _diffconfig is active.
_diffconfig_name=""

#### KERNEL OPTIONS ####

# Name of the default config file to use from the linux???-tkg-config folder. Arch default is "config.x86_64" and Arch hardened is "config_hardened.x86_64".
# To get a complete hardened setup, you have to use "cfs" as _cpusched
_configfile="config.x86_64"

# Disable some non-module debugging - See PKGBUILD for the list
_debugdisable="false"

# LEAVE AN EMPTY VALUE TO BE PROMPTED ABOUT FOLLOWING OPTIONS AT BUILD TIME

# CPU scheduler - Options are "pds", muqss, "bmq", "cfs" or "cfsturbo" (experimental, for power CPUs https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/7/25/296)
# "pds" is the recommended option for gaming
_cpusched=""

# CPU sched_yield_type - Choose what sort of yield sched_yield will perform
# For PDS and MuQSS: 0: No yield. (Recommended option for gaming on PDS and MuQSS)
#                    1: Yield only to better priority/deadline tasks. (Default - can be unstable with PDS on some platforms)
#                    2: Expire timeslice and recalculate deadline. (Usually the slowest option for PDS and MuQSS, not recommended)
# For BMQ:           0: No yield.
#                    1: Deboost and requeue task. (Default)
#                    2: Set rq skip task.
_sched_yield_type=""

# Round Robin interval is the longest duration two tasks with the same nice level will be delayed for. When CPU time is requested by a task, it receives a time slice equal
# to the rr_interval in addition to a virtual deadline. When using yield_type 2, a low value can help offset the disadvantages of rescheduling a process that has yielded.
# MuQSS default: 6ms"
# PDS default: 4ms"
# BMQ default: 2ms"
# Set to "1" for 2ms, "2" for 4ms, "3" for 6ms, "4" for 8ms, or "default" to keep the chosen scheduler defaults.
_rr_interval=""

# Set to "true" to disable FUNCTION_TRACER/GRAPH_TRACER, lowering overhead but limiting debugging and analyzing of kernel functions - Kernel default is "false"
_ftracedisable="false"

# Set to "true" to disable NUMA, lowering overhead, but breaking CUDA/NvEnc on Nvidia equipped systems - Kernel default is "false"
_numadisable="false"

# Set to "1" to use CattaRappa mode (enabling full tickless), "2" for tickless idle only, or "0" for periodic ticks.
# Full tickless can give higher performances in various cases but, depending on hardware, lower consistency. Just tickless idle can perform better on some platforms (mostly AMD based).
_tickless=""

# Setting this to to "true" can improve latency on PDS (at the cost of throughput) and improve throughput on other schedulers (at the cost of latency) - Can improve VMs performance - Kernel default is "false"
_voluntary_preempt=""

# Set to "true" to enable Device Tree and Open Firmware support. If you don't know about it, you don't need it - Default is "false"
_OFenable="false"

# Set to "true" to use ACS override patch - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF#Bypassing_the_IOMMU_groups_.28ACS_override_patch.29 - Kernel default is "false"
_acs_override=""

# Set to "true" to add back missing symbol for AES-NI/AVX support on ZFS - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/os-specific/linux/kernel/export_kernel_fpu_functions.patch - Kernel default is "false"
_zfsfix=""

# Set to "true" to enable support for fsync, an experimental replacement for esync found in Valve Proton 4.11+ - https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/2957094910196249305
_fsync=""

# A selection of patches from Zen/Liquorix kernel and additional tweaks for a better gaming experience (ZENIFY) - Default is "true"
_zenify="true"

# compiler optimization level - 1. Optimize for performance (-O2); 2. Optimize harder (-O3); 3. Optimize for size (-Os) - Kernel default is "1"

# Other options :
# - "generic" (to share the package between machines with different CPUs)
# - "native" (use compiler autodetection and will prompt for P6_NOPS - Selecting your arch manually in the list above is recommended instead of this option)
_processor_opt=""

# Make IRQ threading compulsory (FORCE_IRQ_THREADING) - MuQSS only - Default is "false"
_irq_threading="false"

# SMT (Hyperthreading) aware nice priority and policy support (SMT_NICE) - Kernel default is "true" - You can disable this on non-SMT/HT CPUs for lower overhead

_runqueue_sharing=""

# Timer frequency - "500", "750" or "1000" - More options available in kernel config prompt when left empty depending on selected cpusched - Kernel default is "500"
_timer_freq=""

# Default CPU governor - "performance", "ondemand", "schedutil" or leave empty for default (schedutil on AMD and legacy Intel, intel_pstate on modern Intel)
_default_cpu_gov=""

# Use an aggressive ondemand governor instead of default ondemand to improve performance on low loads/high core count CPUs while keeping some power efficiency from frequency scaling.
# It still requires you to either set ondemand as default governor or to select it some way.
_aggressive_ondemand="true"

# On some platforms, an acpi_cpufreq bug affects performance negatively. Set to "true" to disable it as a workaround, but it will use more power.

_disable_acpi_cpufreq=""


#### SPESHUL OPTION ####

# If you want to bypass the stock naming scheme and enforce something else (example : "linux") - Useful for some bootloaders requiring manual entry editing on each release.
# !!! It will also change pkgname - If you don't explicitely need this, don't use it !!!
_custom_pkgbase=""


#### USER PATCHES ####

# community patches - add patches (separated by a space) of your choice by name from the community-patches dir
